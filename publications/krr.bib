  abstract  = "Quality is a complicated and multifarious topic in contemporary Linked Data research. The aspect of literal quality in particular has not yet been rigorously studied. Nevertheless, analyzing and improving the quality of literals is important since literals form a substantial (one in seven statements) and crucial part of the Semantic Web. Specifically, literals allow infinite value spaces to be expressed and they provide the linguistic entry point to the LOD Cloud. We present a toolchain that builds on the LOD Laundromat data cleaning and republishing infrastructure and that allows us to analyze the quality of literals on a very large scale, using a collection of quality criteria we specify in a systematic way. We illustrate the viability of our approach by lifting out two particular aspects in which the current LOD Cloud can be immediately improved by automated means: value canonization and language tagging. Since not all quality aspects can be addressed algorithmically, we also give an overview of other problems that can be used to guide future endeavors in tooling, training, and best practice formulation.",

  abstract  = "In modern machine learning, raw data is the pre-ferred input for our models. Where a decade ago data sci-entists were still engineering features, manually picking out the details they thought salient, they now prefer the data as raw as possible. As long as we can assume that all relevant and irrelevant information is present in the input data, we can design deep models that build up intermediate represen-tations to sift out relevant features. In some areas, however, we struggle to find this raw form of data. One such area involves heterogeneous knowledge: entities, their attributes and internal relations. The Semantic Web community has in-vested decades of work on just this problem: how to repre-sent knowledge, in various domains, in as raw and as usable a form as possible, satisfying many use cases. This work has led to the Linked Open Data Cloud, a vast and distributed knowledge graph. If we can develop methods that operate on this raw form of data–the knowledge graph–we can dispense with a great deal of ad-hoc feature engineering and train deep models end-to-end in many more domains. In this position paper, we describe current research in this area and discuss some of the promises and challenges of this approach.",

These paradigms are useful for different tasks, cover different use cases, and are implemented by reusing and/or developing Open Source libraries and applications.",

  abstract = "The Netherlands' Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency - in short Kadaster - collects and registers administrative and spatial data on property and the rights involved. This includes for ships, aircraft and telecommunications networks. Doing so, Kadaster protects legal certainty. The Kadaster publishes many large authoritative datasets including several key registers of the Dutch Government (Topography, Addresses and Buildings). Furthermore Kadaster is also developing and maintaining the PDOK shared service, in which about 100 spatial datasets are being published in several formats, including an incredible amount of detailed geospatial objects. Geospatial objects include all plots of land, all buildings, all roads and all lampposts. These objects are spatially and/or conceptually related, but are maintained by different data curators. As a result these datasets are syntactically and architecturally disjoint, and using them together currently requires non-trivial human labor. In response to this, Kadaster is currently publishing its geo-spatial data assets as Linked Open Data. The standardized query language for Linked Open Geodata is GeoSPARQL. Unfortunately, current tooling does not support writing and evaluating GeoSPARQL queries. This paper presents GeoYASGUI, a GeoSPARQL editor and result-set viewer with IDE capabilities. GeoYASGUI is not a new software product, but an integration of and a collection of updates to existing Open Source libraries. With GeoYASGUI it becomes possible to query the rich Open Data assets of the Kadaster.",

Although some approaches have been proposed to address this issue, important features still require more investigation, such as (re)usability and scalability. To this end, this paper presents an approach that relies on reusable rules for detecting interactions among recommendations coming from various guidelines. It extends a previously proposed knowledge representation model (TMR) to enhance the detection of interactions and it provides a systematic analysis of relevant interactions in the context of multimorbidity. The approach is evaluated in a case study on rehabilitation of breast cancer patients, developed in collaboration with experts. The results are considered promising to support the experts in this task.",

Reasoning is affected by these changes, but the extent and significance of this dependency is not well-studied yet. To address this problem, this paper presents an empirical study on how the distribution of ontological data on the Web affects the outcome of reasoning. We study (1) to what degree datasets depend on external ontologies and (2) to what extent the inclusion of additional ontological information via IRI de-referencing and the owl:imports directive to the input datasets leads to new derivations. We based our study on many RDF datasets and on a large collection of RDFa, and JSON-LD data embedded into HTML pages. We used both Jena and Pellet in order to evaluate the results under different semantics. Our results indicate that remote ontologies are often crucial to obtain non-trivial derivations. Unfortunately, in many cases IRIs were broken and the owl:imports is rarely used. Furthermore, in some cases the inclusion of remote knowledge either did not yield any additional derivation or led to errors. Despite these cases, in general, we found that inclusion of additional ontologies via IRIs de-referencing and owl:imports directive is very effective for producing new derivations. This indicates that the two W3C standards for fetching remote ontologies have found their way into practice.",

It contains more than 6.8 million statistical observations about the demography, labour and housing of Dutch society in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The dataset is modeled using the RDF Data Cube, Open Annotation, and PROV vocabularies. These are used to represent the multidimensionality of the data, to express rules of data harmonization, and to keep track of the provenance of all data points and their transformations, respectively. We link observations within the dataset to well known standard classification systems in social history, such as the Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO) and the Amsterdamse Code (AC). The three contributions of the dataset are (1) an easier access to integrated census data for historical researchers; (2) richer connections to related Linked Data resources; and (3) novel concept schemes of historical relevance, like classifications of historical religions and historical house types.",

A large number of medical knowledge sources have by now been converted to knowledge graphs, covering everything from drugs to trials and from vocabularies to gene-disease associations. Such knowledge graphs have typically been generic, covering very large areas of medicine. (e.g. all of internal medicine, or arbitrary drugs, arbitrary trials, etc.). This has had the effect that such knowledge graphs become prohibitively large, hampering both efficiency for machines and usability for people.

Evidence-based medical guidelines should be regularly updated, such that they can serve medical practice using based on the latest medical research evidence. A usual approach to detecting new evidences is to use a set of terms which appear in a guideline conclusion or recommendation and create queries over a bio-medical search engine such as PubMed with a ranking over a selected subset of terms to search for relevant new research papers. However, the sizes of the found relevant papers are usually very large (i.e. over a few hundreds, even thousands), which results in a low precision of the search. This makes it for medical professionals quite difficult to find which papers are really interesting and useful for updating the guideline. We propose a filtering step to decrease the number of papers. More exactly we are interested in the question if we can reduce the number of papers with no or a slightly lower recall. A plausible approach is to introduce journal filtering, such that evidence appear in those top journals are preferred. In this paper, we extend our approach of detecting new papers for updating evidence-based medical guideline with a journal filtering step. We report our experiments and show that (1) the method with journal filtering can indeed gain a large reduction of the number of papers (69.73%) with a slightly lower recall (14.29%); (2) we show that the journal filtering method keeps relatively more high level evidence papers (category A) and removes all the low level evidence papers (category D).",

The objective of this study is to investigate whether Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from a Chinese diabetes specialty hospital can be used for the automated computation of a set of 38 diabetes quality indicators, especially process-related indicators. The clinical quality indicator formalization (CLIF) method and tool and SNOMED CT were adopted to formalize diabetes indicators into executable queries. The formalized indicators were run on the patient data to test the feasibility of their automated computation. In this study, we successfully formalized and computed 32 of 38 quality indicators based on the EMR data. The results indicate that the data from our Chinese EMR can be used for the formalization and computation of most diabetes indicators, but that it can be improved to support the computation of more indicators.",

Previous research has extracted many serendipity-fostering patterns applicable to digital data-driven systems. Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web which is powered by the Follow-Your-Nose effect, provides already a rich source for serendipity. The serendipity most often takes place when browsing data. Therefore, flexible and intuitive browsing user interfaces which support serendipity triggers such as enigmas, anomalies and novelties, can increase the likelihood of serendipity on LOD. In this work, we propose a set of serendipity-fostering design features supported by an adaptive multigraph-based faceted browsing interface to catalyze serendipity on Semantic Web and LOD environments.",

However, it is widely acknowledged that the owl:sameAs construct is too blunt a tool for this purpose. It entails full equality between two resources independent of context. But whether or not two resources should be considered equal depends not only on their intrinsic properties, but also on the purpose or task for which the resources are used. We present a system for constructing contextspecific equality links. In a first step, our system generates a set of probable links between two given datasets. These potential links are decorated with rich metadata describing how, why, when and by whom they were generated. In a second step, a user then selects the links which are suited for the current task and context, constructing a context-specific “Lenticular Lens”. Such lenses can be combined using operators such as union, intersection, difference and composition. We illustrate and validate our approach with",

However, making use of this unique resource has proven next to impossible in the past due to a number of problems, including data collection, quality, accessibility, scalability, availability and findability. The LOD Laundromat and LOD Lab are recent infrastructures that addresses these problems in a systematic way, by automatically crawling, cleaning, indexing, analysing and republishing data in a unified way. Given a family of simple tools, LOD Lab allows researchers to query, access, analyse and manipulate hundreds of thousands of data documents seamlessly, e.g. facilitating experiments (e.g. for reasoning) over hundreds of thousands of (possibly integrated) datasets based on content and meta-data. This chapter provides the theoretical basis and practical skills required for making ideal use of this large scale experimental platform. First we study the problems that make it so hard to work with Semantic Web data in its current form. We’ll also propose generic solutions and introduce the tools the reader needs to get started with their own experiments on the LOD Cloud.",

These data are published in a decentralized fashion and they stem from different sources, have different types of relationships, and use different terminologies, ontologies and meta models.

Using these metrics, we compare our results to non-LOD networks, such as email, Web, and protein networks, that have been reported in the literature.

More and more data give the engineers an overload work problem, which can be solved by a systematic method making these monitoring systems more reliable, efficient and intelligent. Under the framework of the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T), we design a monitoring system for the SBS, by using the semantic technology. This system establishes a data cycle among the physical world (buildings), the social world (humans) and the cyber world (computers), and provides various services in the monitoring process to alleviate the engineers’ workload. In this system, the sensors which are connected via cable or wireless way, are used to monitor the different parameters of building structure. The semantic data can be obtained and represented by RDF to describe the meanings of sensor data, and can provide the application background for users. LarKC, a platform for scalable semantic data processing, is used for semantic querying about the data. Based on this uniform representation of data and semantic processing, intelligent services can be provided by the effective data analysis. This provides the possibility to integrate all of the monitoring systems for the safety of building structure in urban computing.",

These mobile phone data represent the practical travel routes of users and imply the intelligence of them in selecting a suitable route. Usually, an experienced user knows which route is congested in a specified period of time but unblocked in another period of time. Moreover, a route used frequently and recently by a user is usually the suitable one to satisfy the user’s needs. ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) is a computational cognitive architecture, which provides a good framework to understand the principles and mechanisms of information organization, retrieval and selection in human memory. In this chapter, we employ ACT-R to model the process of selecting a suitable route of users. We propose a cognition-inspired route recommendation method to mine the intelligence of users in selecting a suitable route, evaluate the suitability of the routes, and recommend an ordered list of routes for subscribers. Experiments show that it is effective and feasible to recommend the suitable routes inspired by cognition.",

Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) cycle, namely, “from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.” The W2T cycle leads to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers and things, which can be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances in cloud computing, the Internet/Web of Things, big data and other research fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource sharing/services. The next step is therefore to develop an open and interoperable content architecture with intelligence sharing/services for the organization and transformation in the “data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW)” hierarchy. This chapter introduces Wisdom as a Service (WaaS) as a content architecture based on the “paying only for what you use” IT business trend. The WaaS infrastructure, WaaS economics, and the main challenges in WaaS research and applications are discussed. A case study is described to demonstrate the usefulness and significance of WaaS. Relying on the clouds (cloud computing), things (Internet of Things) and big data, WaaS provides a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications.",

  title     = "Predictive modeling of colorectal cancer using a dedicated pre-processing pipeline on routine electronic medical records",
  abstract  = "Over the past years, research utilizing routine care data extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) has increased tremendously. Yet there are no straightforward, standardized strategies for pre-processing these data. We propose a dedicated medical pre-processing pipeline aimed at taking on many problems and opportunities contained within EMR data, such as their temporal, inaccurate and incomplete nature. The pipeline is demonstrated on a dataset of routinely recorded data in general practice EMRs of over 260,000 patients, in which the occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is predicted using various machine learning techniques (i.e., CART, LR, RF) and subsets of the data. CRC is a common type of cancer, of which early detection has proven to be important yet challenging. The results are threefold. First, the predictive models generated using our pipeline reconfirmed known predictors and identified new, medically plausible, predictors derived from the cardiovascular and metabolic disease domain, validating the pipeline's effectiveness. Second, the difference between the best model generated by the data-driven subset (AUC 0.891) and the best model generated by the current state of the art hypothesis-driven subset (AUC 0.864) is statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval level. Third, the pipeline itself is highly generic and independent of the specific disease targeted and the EMR used. In conclusion, the application of established machine learning techniques in combination with the proposed pipeline on EMRs has great potential to enhance disease prediction, and hence early detection and intervention in medical practice.",

  abstract  = "This work aims at reducing the main-memory footprint in high performance hybrid OLTP&OLAP databases, while retaining high query performance and transactional throughput. For this purpose, an innovative compressed columnar storage format for cold data, called Data Blocks is introduced. Data Blocks further incorporate a new light-weight index structure called Positional SMA that narrows scan ranges within Data Blocks even if the entire block cannot be ruled out. To achieve highest OLTP performance, the compression schemes of Data Blocks are very light-weight, such that OLTP transactions can still quickly access individual tuples. This sets our storage scheme apart from those used in specialized analytical databases where data must usually be bit-unpacked. Up to now, high-performance analytical systems use either vectorized query execution or {"}just-in-time{"} (JIT) query compilation. The fine-grained adaptivity of Data Blocks necessitates the integration of the best features of each approach by an interpreted vectorized scan subsystem feeding into JIT-compiled query pipelines. Experimental evaluation of HyPer, our full-edged hybrid OLTP&OLAP database system, shows that Data Blocks accelerate performance on a variety of query workloads while retaining high transaction throughput.",

VectorH achieves fault tolerance and storage scalability by relying on HDFS, and extends the state-of-the-art in SQL-on-Hadoop systems by instrumenting the HDFS replication policy to optimize read locality. VectorH integrates with YARN for workload management, achieving a high degree of elasticity. Even though HDFS is an append-only file-system, and VectorH supports (update-averse) ordered tables, trickle updates are possible thanks to Positional Delta Trees (PDTs), a diffferential update structure that can be queried efficiently. We describe the changes made to single-server Vectorwise to turn it into a Hadoop-based MPP system, encompassing workload management, parallel query optimization and execution, HDFS storage, transaction processing and Spark integration. We evaluate VectorH against HAWQ, Impala, SparkSQL and Hive, showing orders of magnitude better performance.",

  abstract  = "Analytical workloads in data warehouses often include heavy joins where queries involve multiple fact tables in addition to the typical star-patterns, dimensional grouping and selections. In this paper we propose a new processing and storage framework called bitwise dimensional co-clustering (BDCC) that avoids replication and thus keeps updates fast, yet is able to accelerate all these foreign key joins, efficiently support grouping and pushes down most dimensional selections. The core idea of BDCC is to cluster each table on a mix of dimensions, each possibly derived from attributes imported over an incoming foreign key and this way creating foreign key connected tables with partially shared clusterings. These are later used to accelerate any join between two tables that have some dimension in common and additionally permit to push down and propagate selections (reduce I/O) and accelerate aggregation and ordering operations. Besides the general framework, we describe an algorithm to derive such a physical co-clustering database automatically and describe query processing and query optimization techniques that can easily be fitted into existing relational engines. We present an experimental evaluation on the TPC-H benchmark in the Vectorwise system, showing that co-clustering can significantly enhance its already high performance and at the same time significantly reduce the memory consumption of the system.",

In this paper, we compare the organisation and retrieval of architectural knowledge in a file-based documentation approach and an ontology-based documentation approach. The ontology-based approach offers a multi-dimensional organisation of architectural knowledge by means of a software ontology and semantic wiki, whereas file-based documentation typically uses hierarchical organisation by directory structure and table of content. We conducted case studies in two companies to study the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieving architectural knowledge from the different organisations of knowledge. We found that the use of better knowledge organisation correlates with the efficiency and effectiveness of AK retrieval. Professionals who used the knowledge organisation found this beneficial.",

  abstract  = "Identity relations are at the foundation of the Semantic Web and the Linked Data Cloud. In many instances the classical interpretation of identity is too strong for practical purposes. This is particularly the case when two entities are considered the same in some but not all contexts. Unfortunately, modeling the specific contexts in which an identity relation holds is cumbersome and, due to arbitrary reuse and the Open World Assumption, it is impossible to anticipate all contexts in which an entity will be used. We propose an alternative semantics for owl:sameAs that partitions the original relation into a hierarchy of subrelations. The subrelation to which an identity statement belongs depends on the dataset in which the statement occurs. Adding future assertions may change the subrelation to which an identity statement belongs, resulting in a context-dependent and non-monotonic semantics. We show that this more fine-grained semantics is better able to characterize the actual use of owl:sameAs as observed in Linked Open Datasets.",

This paper presents an adaptive component-based approach together with its open source implementation for creating flexible and reusable SW interfaces driven by Linked Data. Linked Data-driven (LD-R) Web components abstract the complexity of the underlying SW technologies in order to allow reuse of existing Web components in LDAs, enabling Web developers who are not experts in SW to develop interfaces that view, edit and browse Linked Data. In addition to the modularity provided by the LD-R components, the proposed RDF-based configuration method allows application assemblers to reshape their user interface for different use cases, by either reusing existing shared configurations or by creating their proprietary configurations.",

At the same time it is a well-known aspect of Semantic Web pragmatics that IRIs are often constructed mnemonically, in order to be meaningful to a human interpreter. The latter has traditionally been termed ‘social meaning’, a concept that has been discussed but not yet quantitatively studied by the Semantic Web community. In this paper we use measures of mutual information content and methods from statistical model learning to quantify the meaning that is (at least) encoded in Semantic Web names. We implement the approach and evaluate it over hundreds of thousands of datasets in order to illustrate its efficacy. Our experiments confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed meaningful and, more interestingly, we provide a quantitative lower bound on how much meaning is encoded in names on a per-dataset basis. To our knowledge, this is the first paper about the interaction between social and formal meaning, as well as the first paper that uses statistical model learning as a method to quantify meaning in the Semantic Web context. These insights are useful for the design of a new generation of Semantic Web tools that take such social meaning into account.",

Such evidence-based medical guidelines should be regularly updated, so that they can optimally serve medical practice by using the latest evidence from medical research. The usual approach to detect such new evidence is to use a set of terms from a guideline recommendation and to create queries for a biomedical search engine such as PubMed, with a ranking over a selected subset of terms to search for relevant new evidence. However, the terms that appear in a guideline recommendation do not always cover all of the information we need for the search, because the contextual information (e.g. time and location, user profile, topics) is usually missing in a guideline recommendation. Enhancing the search terms with contextual information would improve the quality of the search results. In this paper, we propose a topic-centric approach to detect new evidence for updating evidence-based medical guidelines as a context-aware method to improve the search. Our experiments show that this topic centric approach can find the goal evidence for 12 guideline statements out of 16 in our test set, compared with only 5 guideline statements that were found by using a non-topic centric approach.",

In this paper we investigate how computers and in particular RDF stores can take advantage from this emergent schema to more compactly store RDF data and more efficiently optimize and execute SPARQL queries. To this end, we contribute techniques for efficient emergent schema aware RDF storage and new query operator algorithms for emergent schema aware scans and joins.

In this paper, we introduce the Join Order Benchmark (JOB) and experimentally revisit the main components in the classic query optimizer architecture using a complex, real-world data set and realistic multi-join queries. We investigate the quality of industrial-strength cardinality estimators and find that all estimators routinely produce large errors. We further show that while estimates are essential for finding a good join order, query performance is unsatisfactory if the query engine relies too heavily on these estimates. Using another set of experiments that measure the impact of the cost model, we find that it has much less influence on query performance than the cardinality estimates. Finally, we investigate plan enumeration techniques comparing exhaustive dynamic programming with heuristic algorithms and find that exhaustive enumeration improves performance despite the sub-optimal cardinality estimates.",

  abstract  = "The formal representation of clinical knowledge is still an open research topic. Classical representation languages for clinical guidelines are used to produce diagnostic and treatment plans. However, they have important limitations, e.g. when looking for ways to re-use, combine, and reason over existing clinical knowledge. These limitations are especially problematic in the context of multimorbidity; patients that suffer from multiple diseases. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a model for clinical guidelines (TMR4I) that allows the re-use and combination of knowledge from multiple guidelines. Semantic Web technology is applied to implement the model, allowing us to automatically infer interactions between recommendations, such as recommending the same drug more than once. It relies on an existing Linked Data set, DrugBank, for identifying drug-drug interactions. We evaluate the model by applying it to two realistic case studies on multimorbidity that combine guidelines for two (Duodenal Ulcer and Transient Ischemic Attack) and three diseases (Osteoarthritis, Hypertension and Diabetes) and compare the results with existing methods.",

  abstract  = "In this paper we report the results of Phil@Scale, a project directed at the development of computational methods for (the history of) philosophy.1 In this project, philosophers and computer scientists together created SalVe, a tool that helps philosophers answering text-based questions. SalVe has been tested successfully on the Wissenschaftslehre (1837), an extensive work by the Bohemian polymath Bernard Bolzano (1781-1848). Bolzano was a philosopher, mathematician and theologian whose work has been of fundamental importance for the development of Western logic and the foundation of sciences such as mathematics and computer science. The testing of SalVe on the Wissenschaftslehre reveals that with respect to certain questions within philosophy valuable contributions are obtained by applying even rather simple, well-known computational techniques. We conclude that there is definitely a future for computational methods within text-based philosophical research. We explain how SalVe can be used within philosophical research that relies on textual sources. We will start out with an explanation of our aims in developing SalVe and give a short description of SalVe's functionalities, followed by a technical description of the tool. Then we will give a concrete example of how SalVe aids philosophical research. We conclude the paper with an evaluation of the potential of Digital Humanities tools for philosophy, and the challenges that face us if we wish to continue this development further.",

However, often guidelines need to be combined for treating patients that suffer from multiple diseases, and then a number of interactions can occur. The generic interaction rules are implemented in SWI-Prolog and the guideline RDF-data is enriched with clinical Linked Open Data (LOD) (e.g. Drugbank, Sider).

Most rural areas of developing countries are not reached by the Web and its possibilities, while at the same time the ability to share knowledge has been identified as a key enabler for development. To make widespread knowledge sharing possible in these rural areas, the notion of the Web has to be downscaled based on the specific low-resource infrastructure in place. In this paper, we introduce SPARQL over SMS, a solution for Web-like exchange of RDF data over cellular networks in which HTTP is substituted by SMS. We motivate and validate this through two use cases in West Africa. We present the design and implementation of the solution, along with a data compression method that combines generic compression strategies and strategies that use Semantic Web specific features to reduce the size of RDF before it is transferred over the low-bandwidth cellular network.",

We show the potential of expressing digital music as Linked Data, using our midi2rdf suite of tools to convert and stream digital music in MIDI format to RDF. The conversion allows for lossless round tripping: we can reconstruct a MIDI file identical to the original using its RDF representation. The streaming uses an existing, novel generative audio matching algorithm that we use to broadcast, with very low latency, RDF triples of MIDI events coming from arbitrary analog instruments.",

The LDBC introduced a new choke-point driven methodology for developing benchmark workloads, which combines user input with input from expert systems architects, which we outline. This paper describes the LDBC Social Network Benchmark (SNB), and presents database benchmarking innovation in terms of graph query functionality tested, correlated graph generation techniques, as well as a scalable benchmark driver on a workload with complex graph dependencies. SNB has three query workloads under development: Interactive, Business Intelligence, and Graph Algorithms.

  abstract  = "While catchphrases such as big data, smart data, data-intensive science, or smart dust highlight different aspects, they share a common theme - namely, a shift toward a data-centered perspective in which the synthesis and analysis of data at an ever-increasing spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution promise new insights, while, at the same time, reduce the need for strong domain theories as starting points. In terms of the envisioned methodologies, those catchphrases tend to emphasize the role of predictive analytics, that is, statistical techniques including data mining and machine learning, as well as supercomputing. Interestingly, however, while this perspective takes the availability of data as a given, it does not answer the question how one would discover the required data in today's chaotic information universe, how one would understand which data sets can be meaningfully integrated, and how to communicate the results to humans and machines alike. The semantic web addresses these questions. In the following, we argue why the data train needs semantic rails. We point out that making sense of data and gaining new insights work best if inductive and deductive techniques go hand-in-hand instead of competing over the prerogative of interpretation.",

  abstract  = "While almost all dictionary compression techniques focus on static RDF data, we present a compact in-memory RDF dictionary for dynamic and streaming data. To do so, we analysed the structure of terms in real-world datasets and observed a high degree of common prefixes. We studied the applicability of Trie data structures on RDF data to reduce the memory occupied by common prefixes and discovered that all existing Trie implementations lead to either poor performance, or an excessive memory wastage. In our approach, we address the existing limitations of Tries for RDF data, and propose a new variant of Trie which contains some optimizations explicitly designed to improve the performance on RDF data. Furthermore, we show how we use this Trie as an in-memory dictionary by using as numerical ID a memory address instead of an integer counter. This design removes the need for an additional decoding data structure, and further reduces the occupied memory. An empirical analysis on realworld datasets shows that with a reasonable overhead our technique uses 50–59% less memory than a conventional uncompressed dictionary.",

However, more and more data bring a challenge for data management and data mining. In order to meet this challenge, under the framework of Wisdom Web of Things (W2T), we design a monitoring system for the SBS by using the semantic and the multisource data fusion technologies. This system establishes a dynamical data cycle among the physical world (buildings), the social world (humans), and the cyber world (computers) and provides various services in the monitoring process to alleviate engineers' workload. Furthermore, all data in the cyber world are organized as the raw data, the semantic information, and the multisource knowledge. Based on this organization, we can concentrate on the data fusion from the viewpoints of time, space, and multisensor. At last, a prototype system powered by the semantic platform LarKC is tested from the aspects of sample performance and time consumption. In particular, noisy data (i.e., inconsistent, abnormal, or error data) are detected through the fusion of multisource knowledge, and some rule-based reasoning is conducted to provide personalized service.",

These mobile phone data represent the practical travel routes of users and imply the intelligence of them in selecting a suitable route. Usually, an experienced user knows which route is congested in a specified period of time but unblocked in another period of time. Moreover, a route used frequently and recently by a user is usually the suitable one to satisfy the user’s needs. Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R) is a computational cognitive architecture, which provides a good framework to understand the principles and mechanisms of information organization, retrieval and selection in human memory. In this paper, we employ ACT-R to model the process of selecting a suitable route of users. We propose a cognition-inspired route evaluation method to mine the intelligence of users in selecting a suitable route, evaluate the suitability of the routes, and then recommend an ordered list of routes for subscribers. Experiments show that it is effective and feasible to evaluate the suitability of the routes inspired by cognition.",

  title     = "Enhancing reuse of structured eligibility criteria and supporting their relaxation.",
  abstract  = "Patient recruitment is one of the most important barriers to successful completion of clinical trials and thus to obtaining evidence about new methods for prevention, diagnostics and treatment. The reason is that recruitment is effort consuming. It requires the identification of candidate patients for the trial (the population under study), and verifying for each patient whether the eligibility criteria are met. The work we describe in this paper aims to support the comparison of population under study in different trials, and the design of eligibility criteria for new trials. We do this by introducing structured eligibility criteria, that enhance reuse of criteria across trials. We developed a method that allows for automated structuring of criteria from text. Additionally, structured eligibility criteria allow us to propose suggestions for relaxation of criteria to remove potentially unnecessarily restrictive conditions. We thereby increase the recruitment potential and generalizability of a trial.Our method for automated structuring of criteria enables us to identify related conditions and to compare their restrictiveness. The comparison is based on the general meaning of criteria, comprised of commonly occurring contextual patterns, medical concepts and constraining values. These are automatically identified using our pattern detection algorithm, state of the art ontology annotators and semantic taggers. The comparison uses predefined relations between the patterns, concept equivalences defined in medical ontologies, and threshold values. The result is a library of structured eligibility criteria which can be browsed using fine grained queries. Furthermore, we developed visualizations for the library that enable intuitive navigation of relations between trials, criteria and concepts. These visualizations expose interesting co-occurrences and correlations, potentially enhancing meta-research.The method for criteria structuring processes only certain types of criteria, which results in low recall of the method (18%) but a high precision for the relations we identify between the criteria (94%). Analysis of the approach from the medical perspective revealed that the approach can be beneficial for supporting trial design, though more research is needed.",

In this paper, we propose a method for finding relevant evidence for supporting the medical guideline updating process.

We built a prototype and performed a feasibility study on a set of old recommendations, and compared the output to evidence for the newer version. The system succeeded in finding goal articles for 11 out of 16 recommendations, but in total, only 20 out of 71 articles were retrieved.

  abstract  = "In this paper, we describe foxPSL, a fast, optimized and extended implementation of Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based on the distributed graph processing framework Signal/Collect. PSL is one of the leading formalisms of statistical relational learning, a recently developed field of machine learning that aims at representing both uncertainty and rich relational structures, usually by combining logical representations with probabilistic graphical models. PSL can be seen as both a probabilistic logic and a template language for hinge-loss Markov Random Fields, a type of continuous Markov Random fields (MRF) in which Maximum a Posteriori inference is very efficient, since it can be formulated as a constrained convex minimization problem, as opposed to a discrete optimization problem for standard MRFs. From the logical perspective, a key feature of PSL is the capability to represent soft truth values, allowing the expression of complex domain knowledge, like degrees of truth, in parallel with uncertainty. foxPSL supports the full PSL pipeline from problem definition to a distributed solver that implements the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) consensus optimization. It provides a Domain Specific Language that extends standard PSL with a class system and existential quantifiers, allowing for efficient grounding. Moreover, it implements a series of configurable optimizations, like optimized grounding of constraints and lazy inference, that improve grounding and inference time. We perform an extensive evaluation, comparing the performance of foxPSL to a state-of-the-art implementation of ADMM consensus optimization in GraphLab, and show an improvement in both inference time and solution quality. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the optimizations on the execution time and discuss the trade-offs related to each optimization.",

  abstract  = "Background Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is likely to reduce burden of disease and improve treatment success. Estimation of the individual patient risk for CRC diagnostic determinants in a primary care setting has not been very successful as yet. The aim of our study is to improve prediction of CRC in patients selected for colonoscopy in the primary healthcare setting using readily available routine healthcare data. Patients and methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Julius General Practitioners' Network database. Patients referred for colonoscopy by their general practitioner (GP) between 2007 and 2012 were selected. We evaluated the association between long-term registered patient characteristics, symptoms and conditions, and colonoscopy test results with multivariable logistic regression. Results Two per cent (2787/140 000) of the patients between 30 and 85 years were found to be newly referred for colonoscopy by their GP, of whom 57 (2%) were diagnosed with CRC. Age 50 years or over, hypertension and the absence of preceding consultations for abdominal pain were independent predictors for CRC and/or high-risk adenomas, with an area under the curve of 0.65. Conclusion Three factors in routine care data combined might prove valuable in future strategies to improve the prediction of CRC risk in primary care. Improvement in quality and availability of routine care data for research and risk stratification is needed to optimize its usability for prediction purposes in daily practice. Impact Only referring patients at the highest risk for colonoscopy by the GP could decrease superfluous colonoscopies.",

  abstract  = "Ad-hoc querying is crucial to access information from Linked Data, yet publishing queryable RDF datasets on the Web is not a trivial exercise. The most compelling argument to support this claim is that the Web contains hundreds of thousands of data documents, while only 260 queryable SPARQL endpoints are provided. Even worse, the SPARQL endpoints we do have are often unstable, may not comply with the standards, and may differ in supported features. In other words, hosting data online is easy, but publishing Linked Data via a queryable API such as SPARQL appears to be too difficult. As a consequence, in practice, there is no single uniform way to query the LOD Cloud today. In this paper, we therefore combine a large-scale Linked Data publication project (LOD Laundromat) with a low-cost server-side interface (Triple Pattern Fragments), in order to bridge the gap between the Web of downloadable data documents and the Web of live queryable data. The result is a repeatable, low-cost, open-source data publication process. To demonstrate its applicability, we made over 650,000",

  abstract  = "Contemporary Semantic Web research is in the business of optimizing algorithms for only a handful of datasets such as DBpedia, BSBM, DBLP and only a few more. This means that current practice does not generally take the true variety of Linked Data into account. With hundreds of thousands of datasets out in the world today the re- sults of SemanticWeb evaluations are less generalizable than they should and—this paper argues—can be. This paper describes LOD Lab: a fun- damentally different evaluation paradigm that makes algorithmic evalu- ation against hundreds of thousands of datasets the new norm. LOD Lab is implemented in terms of the existing LOD Laundromat architecture combined with the new open-source programming interface Frank that supportsWeb-scale evaluations to be run from the command-line.We il- lustrate the viability of the LOD Lab approach by rerunning experiments from three recent SemanticWeb research publications and expect it will contribute to improving the quality and reproducibility of experimental work in the Semantic Web community. We show that simply rerunning existing experiments within this new evaluation paradigm brings up in- teresting research questions as to how algorithmic performance relates to (structural) properties of the data. 1",

Among the ‘‘technologies for the mitigation of climate change’’ (class Y02), we zoom in on nine material technologies for photovoltaic cells; and focus on one of them (CuInSe2) as a lead case. Two recently developed techniques for making patent maps with interactive overlays—geographical ones using Google Maps and maps based on citation relations among International Patent Classifications (IPC)—are elaborated into dynamic versions that allow for online animations and comparisons by using split screens. Various forms of animation are discussed. The longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity in the IPC-based maps provided us with a heuristics for studying technological diversity in terms of generations of the technology. The longitudinal patterns are clear in USPTO data more than in PatStat data because PatStat aggregates patent information from countries in different stages of technological development, whereas one can expect USPTO patents to be competitive at the technological edge.",

  abstract  = "Scientific communities are increasingly publishing datasets on the Web following the Linked Data principles, storing RDF graphs in triplestores and making them available for querying through SPARQL. However, solving domain-specific problems often relies on information that cannot be included in such triplestores. For example, it is virtually impossible to foresee, and precompute, all statistical tests users will want to run on these datasets, especially if data from external triplestores is involved. A straightforward solution is to query the triplestore with SPARQL and compute the required information post-hoc. However, post-hoc scripting is laborious and typically not reusable, and the computed information is not accessible within the original query. Other solutions allow this computation to happen at query time, as with SPARQL Extensible Value Testing (EVT) and Linked Data APIs. However, such approaches can be difficult to apply, due to limited interoperability and poor extensibility. In this paper we present SCRY, the SPARQL compatible service layer, which is a lightweight SPARQL endpoint that interprets parts of basic graph patterns as calls to user defined services. SCRY allows users to incorporate algorithms of arbitrary complexity within standards-compliant SPARQL queries, and to use the generated outputs directly within these same queries. Unlike traditional SPARQL endpoints, the RDF graph against which SCRY resolves its queries is generated at query time, by executing services encoded in the basic graph patterns. SCRY's federation-oriented design allows for easy integration with existing SPARQL endpoints, effectively extending their functionality in a decoupled, tool independent way and allowing the power of SemanticWeb technology to be more easily applied to domain-specific problems.",

This can also not be expected to change, since text, images and videos are the natural way how humans interact with information. Semantic structuring on the other hand enables the (semi-)automatic integration, repurposing, rearrangement of information. NLP technologies and formalisms for the integrated representation of unstructured and semantic content (such as RDFa and Microdata) aim at bridging this semantic gap. However, in order for humans to truly benefit from this integration, we need ways to author, visualize and explore unstructured and semantically enriched content in an integrated manner. In this paper, we present the WYSIWYM (What You See is What You Mean) concept, which addresses this issue and formalizes the binding between semantic representation models and UI elements for authoring, visualizing and exploration. With RDFaCE, Pharmer and conTEXT we present and evaluate three complementary showcases implementing the WYSIWYM concept for different application domains.",

Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) cycle, namely, 'from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.'' The W2T cycle leads to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers, and things, which can be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Web of Things, Big Data, and other research fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource sharing and services. The next step is to develop an open and interoperable content architecture with intelligent sharing and services for the organization and transformation in the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. This article introduces wisdom as a service (WaaS), a content architecture based on the pay-as-you-go IT trend. The WaaS infrastructure and the main challenges in WaaS research and applications are discussed. A case study is also described. Relying on cloud computing and big data, WaaS provides a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications.",

We provide means to (semi)automatically detect interactions among recommendations that require some attention from experts, such as recommending more than once the same drug.

  abstract  = "Data integration is a key challenge faced in pharmacology where there are numerous heterogeneous databases spanning multiple domains (e.g. chemistry and biology). To address this challenge, the Open PHACTS consortium has developed the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform that leverages Linked Data to provide integrated access to pharmacology databases. Between its launch in April 2013 and March 2014, the platform has been accessed over 13.5 million times and has multiple applications that integrate with it. In this work, we discuss how Application Programming Interfaces can extend the classical Linked Data Application Architecture to facilitate data integration. Additionally, we show how the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform implements this extended architecture.",

In this application report, we describe a linked data platform for integrating multiple pharmacology datasets that form the basis for several drug discovery applications. The functionality offered by the platform has been drawn from a collection of prioritised drug discovery business questions created as part of the Open PHACTS project, a collaboration of research institutions and major pharmaceutical companies. We describe the architecture of the platform focusing on seven design decisions that drove its development with the aim of informing others developing similar software in this or other domains. The utility of the platform is demonstrated by the variety of drug discovery applications being built to access the integrated data. An alpha version of the OPS platform is currently available to the Open PHACTS consortium and a first public release will be made in late 2012, see http://www.openphacts.org/ for details. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",

  abstract  = "Inconsistency handling in OWL DL ontologies is an important problem because an ontology can easily be inconsistent when it is generated or modified. Current approaches to dealing with inconsistent ontologies often assume that there exists a total order over axioms and use such an order to select axioms to remove. However, in some cases, such as ontology merging, a total order may not be available and we only have a partial order over axioms. In this paper, we consider a general notion of logical inconsistency and define the notion of conflict of an inconsistent ontology. We then propose a general approach to resolving inconsistency of a partially ordered ontology. We instantiate this approach by proposing two algorithms to calculate prioritized hitting sets for a set of conflicts. We implement the algorithms and provide evaluation results on the efficiency and effectiveness by considering both artificial and real-life data sets.",

Main dependent measures were mood; death-related thoughts; attitudes toward the ad; and purchase intentions. Across studies advertisements with a death reminder increased unconscious thoughts about death (Experiments 1-3), which, in turn, increased purchase intentions (Experiments 2 and 3). These effects occurred independent of mood, brand familiarity, product type, product relevance to self-esteem, and ad liking.

  abstract  = "Objective: Ambiguous definitions of quality measures in natural language impede their automated computability and also the reproducibility, validity, timeliness, traceability, comparability, and interpretability of computed results. Therefore, quality measures should be formalized before their release. We have previously developed and successfully applied a method for clinical indicator formalization (CLIF). The objective of our present study is to test whether CLIF is generalizable- that is, applicable to a large set of heterogeneous measures of different types and from various domains. Materials and methods: We formalized the entire set of 159 Dutch quality measures for general practice, which contains structure, process, and outcome measures and covers seven domains. We relied on a web-based tool to facilitate the application of our method. Subsequently, we computed the measures on the basis of a large database of real patient data. Results: Our CLIF method enabled us to fully formalize 100% of the measures. Owing to missing functionality, the accompanying tool could support full formalization of only 86% of the quality measures into Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. The remaining 14% of the measures required manual application of our CLIF method by directly translating the respective criteria into SQL. The results obtained by computing the measures show a strong correlation with results computed independently by two other parties. Conclusions: The CLIF method covers all quality measures after having been extended by an additional step. Our web tool requires further refinement for CLIF to be applied completely automatically. We therefore conclude that CLIF is sufficiently generalizable to be able to formalize the entire set of Dutch quality measures for general practice.",

  abstract  = "Background: Our study aims to assess the influence of data quality on computed Dutch hospital quality indicators, and whether colorectal cancer surgery indicators can be computed reliably based on routinely recorded data from an electronic medical record (EMR). Methods. Cross-sectional study in a department of gastrointestinal oncology in a university hospital, in which a set of 10 indicators is computed (1) based on data abstracted manually for the national quality register Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit (DSCA) as reference standard and (2) based on routinely collected data from an EMR. All 75 patients for whom data has been submitted to the DSCA for the reporting year 2011 and all 79 patients who underwent a resection of a primary colorectal carcinoma in 2011 according to structured data in the EMR were included. Comparison of results, investigating the causes for any differences based on data quality analysis. Main outcome measures are the computability of quality indicators, absolute percentages of indicator results, data quality in terms of availability in a structured format, completeness and correctness. Results: All indicators were fully computable based on the DSCA dataset, but only three based on EMR data, two of which were percentages. For both percentages, the difference in proportions computed based on the two datasets was significant.All required data items were available in a structured format in the DSCA dataset. Their average completeness was 86%, while the average completeness of these items in the EMR was 50%. Their average correctness was 87%. Conclusions: Our study showed that data quality can significantly influence indicator results, and that our EMR data was not suitable to reliably compute quality indicators. EMRs should be designed in a way so that the data required for audits can be entered directly in a structured and coded format. © 2014 Dentler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

  abstract  = "Abstract The combination of the flexibility of RDF and the expressiveness of SPARQL provides a powerful mechanism to model, integrate and query data. However, these properties also mean that it is nontrivial to write performant SPARQL queries. Indeed, it is quite easy to create queries that tax even the most optimised triple stores. Currently, application developers have little concrete guidance on how to write {"}good{"} queries. The goal of this paper is to begin to bridge this gap. It describes 5 heuristics that can be applied to create optimised queries. The heuristics are informed by formal results in the literature on the semantics and complexity of evaluating SPARQL queries, which ensures that queries following these rules can be optimised effectively by an underlying RDF store. Moreover, we empirically verify the efficacy of the heuristics using a set of openly available datasets and corresponding SPARQL queries developed by a large pharmacology data integration project. The experimental results show improvements in performance across six state-of-the-art RDF stores.",

We present our approach of Parameter Curation with the goal of selecting parameter bindings that have consistently low-variance intermediate query result sizes throughout the query plan. Our solution is illustrated with IMDB data and the recently proposed LDBC Social Network Benchmark (SNB).",

  abstract  = "Understanding how genetic differences between individuals impact the regulation, expression, and ultimately function of proteins is an important step toward realizing the promise of personal medicine. There are several technical barriers hindering the transition of biological knowledge into the applications relevant to precision medicine. One important challenge for data integration is that new biological sequences (proteins, DNA) have multiple issues related to interoperability potentially creating a quagmire in the published data, especially when different data sources do not appear to be in agreement. Thus, there is an urgent need for systems and methodologies to facilitate the integration of information in a uniform manner to allow seamless querying of multiple data types which can illuminate, for example, the relationships between protein modifications and causative genomic variants. Our work demonstrates for the first time how semantic technologies can be used to address these challenges using the nanopublication model applied to the neXtProt data set, a curated knowledgebase of information about human proteins. We have applied the nanopublication model to demonstrate querying over several named graphs, including the provenance information associated with the curated scientific assertions from neXtProt. We show by way of use cases using sequence variations, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and tissue expression, that querying the neXtProt nanopublication implementation is a credible approach for expanding biological insight.",

  abstract  = "Identity relations are at the foundation of many logic-based knowledge representations. We argue that the traditional notion of equality, is unsuited for many realistic knowledge representation settings. The classical interpretation of equality is too strong when the equality statements are re-used outside their original context. On the Semantic Web, equality statements are used to interlink multiple descriptions of the same object, using owl:sameAs assertions. And indeed, many practical uses of owl:sameAs are known to violate the formal Leibniz-style semantics. We provide a more flexible semantics to identity by assigning meaning to the subrelations of an identity relation in terms of the predicates that are used in a knowledge-base. Using those indiscernability-predicates, we define upper and lower approximations of equality in the style of rought-set theory, resulting in a quality-measure for identity relations.",

  title     = "Streaming the Web: Reasoning over dynamic data",
  abstract  = "In the last few years a new research area, called stream reasoning, emerged to bridge the gap between reasoning and stream processing. While current reasoning approaches are designed to work on mainly static data, the Web is, on the other hand, extremely dynamic: information is frequently changed and updated, and new data is continuously generated from a huge number of sources, often at high rate. In other words, fresh information is constantly made available in the form of streams of new data and updates. Despite some promising investigations in the area, stream reasoning is still in its infancy, both from the perspective of models and theories development, and from the perspective of systems and tools design and implementation. The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) we identify the requirements coming from different application scenarios, and we isolate the problems they pose; (ii) we survey existing approaches and proposals in the area of stream reasoning, highlighting their strengths and limitations; (iii) we draw a research agenda to guide the future research and development of stream reasoning. In doing so, we also analyze related research fields to extract algorithms, models, techniques, and solutions that could be useful in the area of stream reasoning. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a conceptual model for representing the content of CGs as a result from an iterative approach that take into account the content of real CGs, CIGs languages and foundational ontologies in order to enhance the reasoning capabilities required to address CIG use-cases. In particular, we apply our approach to the comorbidity use-case and illustrate the model with a realistic case study (Duodenal Ulcer and Transient Ischemic Attack) and compare the results against an existing approach.",

  title     = "Automated generation of patient-tailored electronic care pathways by translating computer-interpretable guidelines into hierarchical task networks",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a methodology which enables computer-aided support for the planning, visualization and execution of personalized patient treatments in a specific healthcare process, taking into account complex temporal constraints and the allocation of institutional resources. To this end, a translation from a time-annotated computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) model of a clinical protocol into a temporal hierarchical task network (HTN) planning domain is presented.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed method uses a knowledge-driven reasoning process to translate knowledge previously described in a CIG into a corresponding HTN Planning and Scheduling domain, taking advantage of HTNs known ability to (i) dynamically cope with temporal and resource constraints, and (ii) automatically generate customized plans. The proposed method, focusing on the representation of temporal knowledge and based on the identification of workflow and temporal patterns in a CIG, makes it possible to automatically generate time-annotated and resource-based care pathways tailored to the needs of any possible patient profile.RESULTS: The proposed translation is illustrated through a case study based on a 70 pages long clinical protocol to manage Hodgkin's disease, developed by the Spanish Society of Pediatric Oncology. We show that an HTN planning domain can be generated from the corresponding specification of the protocol in the Asbru language, providing a running example of this translation. Furthermore, the correctness of the translation is checked and also the management of ten different types of temporal patterns represented in the protocol. By interpreting the automatically generated domain with a state-of-art HTN planner, a time-annotated care pathway is automatically obtained, customized for the patient's and institutional needs. The generated care pathway can then be used by clinicians to plan and manage the patients long-term care.CONCLUSION: The described methodology makes it possible to automatically generate patient-tailored care pathways, leveraging an incremental knowledge-driven engineering process that starts from the expert knowledge of medical professionals. The presented approach makes the most of the strengths inherent in both CIG languages and HTN planning and scheduling techniques: for the former, knowledge acquisition and representation of the original clinical protocol, and for the latter, knowledge reasoning capabilities and an ability to deal with complex temporal and resource constraints. Moreover, the proposed approach provides immediate access to technologies such as business process management (BPM) tools, which are increasingly being used to support healthcare processes.",

  abstract  = "Objective: Ambiguous definitions of quality measures in natural language impede their automated computability and also the reproducibility, validity, timeliness, traceability, comparability, and interpretability of computed results. Therefore, quality measures should be formalized before their release. We have previously developed and successfully applied a method for clinical indicator formalization (CLIF). The objective of our present study is to test whether CLIF is generalizable- that is, applicable to a large set of heterogeneous measures of different types and from various domains. Materials and methods: We formalized the entire set of 159 Dutch quality measures for general practice, which contains structure, process, and outcome measures and covers seven domains. We relied on a web-based tool to facilitate the application of our method. Subsequently, we computed the measures on the basis of a large database of real patient data. Results: Our CLIF method enabled us to fully formalize 100% of the measures. Owing to missing functionality, the accompanying tool could support full formalization of only 86% of the quality measures into Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. The remaining 14% of the measures required manual application of our CLIF method by directly translating the respective criteria into SQL. The results obtained by computing the measures show a strong correlation with results computed independently by two other parties. Conclusions: The CLIF method covers all quality measures after having been extended by an additional step. Our web tool requires further refinement for CLIF to be applied completely automatically. We therefore conclude that CLIF is sufficiently generalizable to be able to formalize the entire set of Dutch quality measures for general practice.",

  abstract  = "Collective decision making involves on the one hand individual mental states such as beliefs, emotions and intentions, and on the other hand interaction with others with possibly different mental states. Achieving a satisfactory common group decision on which all agree requires that such mental states are adapted to each other by social interaction. Recent developments in social neuroscience have revealed neural mechanisms by which such mutual adaptation can be realised. These mechanisms not only enable intentions to converge to an emerging common decision, but at the same time enable to achieve shared underlying individual beliefs and emotions. This paper presents a computational model for such processes. As an application of the model, an agent-based analysis was made of patterns in crowd behaviour, in particular to simulate a real-life incident that took place on May 4, 2010 in Amsterdam. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion. © 2012 The Author(s).",

  abstract  = "Processing large volumes of RDF data requires sophisticated tools. In recent years, much effort was spent on optimizing native RDF stores and on repurposing relational query engines for large-scale RDF processing. Concurrently, a number of new data management systems-regrouped under the NoSQL (for {"}not only SQL{"}) umbrella-rapidly rose to prominence and represent today a popular alternative to classical databases. Though NoSQL systems are increasingly used to manage RDF data, it is still difficult to grasp their key advantages and drawbacks in this context. This work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt at characterizing and comparing NoSQL stores for RDF processing. In the following, we describe four different NoSQL stores and compare their key characteristics when running standard RDF benchmarks on a popular cloud infrastructure using both single-machine and distributed deployments. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

Semantic technologies risk being unable to meet the needs of such applications, as they are not equipped with the appropriate instruments for answering queries over massive, highly dynamic, ordered data sets. In this vision paper, we argue that some data management techniques should be exported to the context of semantic technologies, by integrating ordering with reasoning, and by using methods which are inspired by stream and rank-aware data management.We systematically explore the problem space, and point both to problems which have been successfully approached and to problems which still need fundamental research, in an attempt to stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic technologies. © IOS Press and the authors.

They allow the interlinking of alternative descriptions of the same thing. However, many practical uses of owl:sameAs are known to violate its formal semantics. We propose a method that assigns meaning to (the subrelations of) an identity relation using the predicates of the dataset schema. Applications of this approach include automated suggestions for asserting/retracting identity pairs and quality assessment. We also describe an experimental design for this approach.",

  abstract  = "The presented work contributes to bridging the representation of clinical trials and patient data. Our ultimate goal is to support the trial recruitment, by automating the process of formalizing eligibility criteria of clinical trials, starting from free text of criteria and leading to a computable representation. This paper discusses the final step in the pipeline i.e. generating queries from the structured representation consisting of detected patterns and semantic entities. The queries allow to evaluate patient eligibility for a given trial. To enable easy incorporation of semantic reasoning using medical ontologies, we built the queries in SPARQL and use the OWL representation of one the standards for patient data storage - openEHR archetypes and NCI ontology. The available public repository of archetypes and the expressivity of SPARQL allow to create template queries for the majority of patterns. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

The ontology makes explicit the conceptual knowledge of the legal case domain, supports reasoning about the domain, and can be used to annotate the text of cases, which in turn can be used to populate the ontology. A populated ontology is a case base which can be used for information retrieval, information extraction, and case based reasoning. The ontology contains not only elements for indexing the case (e.g. the parties, jurisdiction, and date), but as well elements used to reason to a decision such as argument schemes and the components input to the schemes. We use the Protégé ontology editor and knowledge acquisition system, current guidelines for ontology development, and tools for visual and linguistic presentation of the ontology. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Our research focuses on three aspects of intelligent assistance for to-dos. We investigated the use of intelligent agents to automate to-dos in an office setting. We collected a large corpus from users and developed a paraphrase-based approach to matching agent capabilities with to-dos. We also investigated to-dos for personal tasks and the kinds of assistance that can be offered to users by elaborating on them on the basis of substep knowledge extracted from the Web. Finally, we explored coordination of user tasks with other users through a to-do management application deployed in a popular social networking site. We discuss the emergence of Social Task Networks, which link users tasks to their social network as well as to relevant resources on the Web. We show the benefits of using common sense knowledge to interpret and elaborate to-dos. Conversely, we also show that to-do lists are a valuable way to create repositories of common sense knowledge about tasks. © 2012 ACM.",

  abstract  = "The Semantic Web has become a dynamic and enormous network of typed links between data sets stored on different machines. These data sets are machine readable and unambiguously interpretable, thanks to their underlying standard representation languages. The expressiveness and flexibility of the publication model of Linked Data has led to its widespread adoption and an ever increasing publication of semantically rich data on the Web. This success however has started to create serious problems as the scale and complexity of information outgrows the current methods in use, which are mostly based on database technology, expressive knowledge representation formalism and high-performance computing. We argue that methods from computational intelligence can play an important role in solving these problems. In this paper we introduce and systemically discuss the typical application problems on the Semantic Web and argue that the existing approaches to address their underlying reasoning tasks consistently fail because of the increasing size, dynamicity and complexity of the data. For each of these primitive reasoning tasks we will discuss possible problem solving methods grounded in Evolutionary and Swarm computing, with short descriptions of existing approaches. Finally, we will discuss two case studies in which we successfully applied soft computing methods to two of the main reasoning tasks; an evolutionary approach to querying, and a swarm algorithm for entailment. © 2012 IEEE.",

  abstract  = "The semi-automatic evaluation of eligibility criteria can facilitate the recruitment for clinical trials, timely completion of studies and generation of clinical evidence about new approaches to treatment, prevention and diagnosis. Because eligibility criteria are represented as free text, automatically extracting their meaning and evaluating them for a particular patient is challenging. This paper presents our approach to the problem of automatic interpretation of criteria meaning. It is based on detecting in text semantic entities (diseases, treatment, measurements etc.) using ontology annotators and semantic taggers, and detecting predefined patterns providing the contextual information in which these entities occur. Evaluation of the approach is the main subject of the paper. It covers several aspects: precision and recall of the pattern detection algorithm and the assessment of the implications of using the identified patterns to find potential candidates. It was performed manually using a subset of patterns and randomly selected 33 trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. The average precision and recall of pattern detection algorithm calculated for selected patterns is 0.9 and 0.91, meaning that in most cases using the patterns can lead to correct interpretation of criteria and can support patient recruitment. © 2012 IEEE.",

  abstract  = "Teamwork between humans and computer agents has become increasingly prevalent. This paper presents a behavioral study of fairness and trust in a heterogeneous setting comprising both computer agents and human participants. It investigates people's choice of teammates and their commitment to their teams in a dynamic environment in which actions occur at a fast pace and decisions are made within tightly constrained time frames, under conditions of uncertainty and partial information. In this setting, participants could form teams by negotiating over the division of a reward for the successful completion of a group task. Participants could also choose to defect from their existing teams in order to join or create other teams. Results show that when people form teams, they offer significantly less reward to agents than they offer to people. The most significant factor affecting people's decisions whether to defect from their existing teams is the extent to which they had successful previous interactions with other team members. Also, there is no significant difference in people's rate of defection from agent-led teams as compared to their defection from human-led teams. These results are significant for agent designers and behavioral researchers who study human-agent interactions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

  title     = "Instance-Based Ontology Matching by Instance Enrichment",
  abstract  = "The ontology matching (OM) problem is an important barrier to achieve true Semantic Interoperability. Instance-based ontology matching (IBOM) uses the extension of concepts, the instances directly associated with a concept, to determine whether a pair of concepts is related or not. While IBOM has many strengths it requires instances that are associated with concepts of both ontologies, (i.e) dually annotated instances. In practice, however, instances are often associated with concepts of a single ontology only, rendering IBOM rarely applicable. In this paper we discuss a method that enables IBOM to be used on two disjoint datasets, thus making it far more generically applicable. This is achieved by enriching instances of each dataset with the conceptual annotations of the most similar instances from the other dataset, creating artificially dually annotated instances. We call this technique instance-based ontology matching by instance enrichment (IBOMbIE). We have applied the IBOMbIE algorithm in a real-life use-case where large datasets are used to match the ontologies of European libraries. Existing gold standards and dually annotated instances are used to test the impact and significance of several design choices of the IBOMbIE algorithm. Finally, we compare the IBOMbIE algorithm to other ontology matching algorithms.",

  abstract  = "Scalable, adaptive and robust approaches to store and analyze the massive amounts of data expected from Semantic Web applications are needed to bring the Web of Data to its full potential. The solution at hand is to distribute both data and requests onto multiple computers. Apart from storage, the annotation of data with machine-processable semantics is essential for realizing the vision of the Semantic Web. Reasoning on webscale data faces the same requirements as storage. Swarm-based approaches have been shown to produce near-optimal solutions for hard problems in a completely decentralized way. We propose a novel concept for reasoning within a fully distributed and self-organized storage system that is based on the collective behavior of swarm individuals and does not require any schema replication. We show the general feasibility and efficiency of our approach with a proof-of-concept experiment of storage and reasoning performance. Thereby, we positively answer the research question of whether swarm-based approaches are useful in creating a large-scale distributed storage and reasoning system. © 2012 IEEE.",

The work reported in this paper is part of a project that aims to develop a Virtual Reality based training environment for such professionals. As a first step in that direction, an experiment was performed to investigate the impact of virtual training on the subjects' experienced stress responses. A group of 10 participants was asked to rate the subjective emotional intensity of a set of affective pictures at two different time points, separated by six hours. Half of the group performed a session of virtual training in between, in which they were asked to actively apply reappraisal strategies as a form of emotion regulation, whereas the other half did not take part in this training session. The results indicate that the virtual training caused the participants in that group to give significantly lower ratings for the emotional intensity of the pictures. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",

  abstract  = "In order to be able to automatically calculate clinical quality indicators, we have proposed CLIF, a stepwise method for clinical quality indicator formalisation. Quality indicators are used for external accountability and hospital comparison. As clinical quality indicators are computed in a decentralised manner by the hospitals themselves, reproducibility of the formalisation method is essential to ensure the comparability of calculated values. Thus, we performed a case study to investigate the reproducibility of CLIF. Eight participants formalised the same sample quality indicator with the help of a web-based indicator-authoring tool that facilitates the application of CLIF. We analysed the results per step and concluded that the method itself leads to reproducible results. To further improve reproducibility, ambiguities in the indicator text must be clarified and trained experts are needed to encode clinical concepts and to specify the relations between concepts. © 2012 European Federation for Medical Informatics and IOS Press.

On a large scale, the resources of single machines are no longer sufficient and we are required to distribute the process to improve performance. The article that we attach to our submission [1] tackles this problem proposing a methodology to perform inference materializing every possible consequence using the MapReduce programming model. We introduce a number of optimizations to address the issues that a naive implementation would raise and to improve the overall performance. We have implemented the presented techniques in a prototype called WebPIE and the evaluation shows that our approach is able to perform complex inference based on the OWL language over a very large input of about 100 billion triples. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only approach that demonstrates complex inference over an input of a hundred billion of triples.",

  abstract  = "This paper provides a survey to and a comparison of state-of-the-art Semantic Web reasoners that succeed in classifying large ontologies expressed in the tractable OWL 2 EL profile. Reasoners are characterized along several dimensions: The first dimension comprises underlying reasoning characteristics, such as the employed reasoning method and its correctness as well as the expressivity and worst-case computational complexity of its supported language and whether the reasoner supports incremental classification, rules, justifications for inconsistent concepts and ABox reasoning tasks. The second dimension is practical usability: whether the reasoner implements the OWL API and can be used via OWLlink, whether it is available as Protégé plugin, on which platforms it runs, whether its source is open or closed and which license it comes with. The last dimension contains performance indicators that can be evaluated empirically, such as classification, concept satisfiability, subsumption checking and consistency checking performance as well as required heap space and practical correctness, which is determined by comparing the computed concept hierarchies with each other. For the very large ontology SNOMED CT, which is released both in stated and inferred form, we test whether the computed concept hierarchies are correct by comparing them to the inferred form of the official distribution. The reasoners are categorized along the defined characteristics and benchmarked against well-known biomedical ontologies. The main conclusion from this study is that reasoners vary significantly with regard to all included characteristics, and therefore a critical assessment and evaluation of requirements is needed before selecting a reasoner for a real-life application. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Then we study concept drift over time using two theories: one based on concept identity and one based on concept morphing. A qualitative toolkit for analysing concept drift is proposed to detect concept shift and stability when concept identity is available, and concept split and strength of morphing chain if using the morphing theory. We apply our framework in four case-studies: a political vocabulary in SKOS, the DBpedia ontology in RDFS, the LKIF-Core ontology in OWL and a few biomedical ontologies in OBO. We describe ways of identifying interesting changes in the meaning of concept within given application contexts. These case-studies illustrate the feasibility of our framework in analysing concept drift in knowledge organisation schemas of varying expressiveness. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  abstract  = "Reasoning is a key element of the Semantic Web. For the Semantic Web to scale, it is required that reasoning also scales. This chapter focuses on two approaches to achieve this: The first deals with increasing the computational power available for a given task by harnessing distributed resources. These distributed resources refer to peer-to-peer networks, federated data stores, or cluster-based computing. The second deals with containing the set of axioms that need to be considered for a given task. This can be achieved by using intelligent selection strategies and limiting the scope of statements. The former is exemplified by methods substituting expensive web-scale reasoning with the cheaper application of heuristics while the latter by methods to control the quality of the provided axioms. Finally, future issues concerning information centralization and logics vs information retrieval-based methods, metrics, and benchmarking are considered.",

  abstract = "The Web of Data (WoD) is an Internet-based network of data resources and their relations. It has recently taken flight and combines over a hundred interlinked data sources with more than 15 billion edges. A consequence of this recent success is that a paradigm shift has taken place: up to now the Web of Data could be studied, searched and maintained like a classical database; nowadays it has turned into a Complex System and needs to be studied as such. In this paper, we introduce the Web of Data as a challenging object of study and provide initial results on two network scales: the pure data-layer, and the global connection between groups data items. In this analysis, we show that the {"}official{"} abstract representation of the WoD does not fit the real distribution we derive from the lower scale. As interesting as these results are, bigger challenges for analysis await in the form of the highly dynamic character of the WoD, and the typed, and implicit, character of the edges which is, to the best of our knowledge, hitherto unstudied. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Tracking provenance within these systems is crucial for determining the trustworthiness of data they produce, troubleshooting problems, assigning responsibility for decisions, and improving performance. To facilitate such tracking, the Open Provenance Model (OPM) has been created to enable the interchange of provenance between a distributed system's components. However, to date, the ability of OPM to represent distributed systems has not been verified. In this work, we show how OPM can be used to represent a set of distributed systems' patterns. We present a profile that shows that these patterns are a specialisation of OPM. Finally, we define a contract that enables participants in a distributed system to ensure that their provenance can be integrated cohesively. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  title     = "Research interests: their dynamics, structures and applications in unifying search and reasoning",
  abstract  = "Most scientific publication information, which may reflects scientists' research interests, is publicly available on the Web. Understanding the characteristics of research interests from previous publications may help to provide better services for scientists in the Web age. In this paper, we introduce some parameters to track the evolution process of research interests, we analyze their structural and dynamic characteristics. According to the observed characteristics of research interests, under the framework of unifying search and reasoning (ReaSearch), we propose interests-based unification of search and reasoning (I-ReaSearch). Under the proposed I-ReaSearch method, we illustrate how research interests can be used to improve literature search on the Web. According to the relationship between an author's own interests and his/her co-authors interests, social group interests are also used to refine the literature search process. Evaluation from both the user satisfaction and the scalability point of view show that the proposed I-ReaSearch method provides a user centered and practical way to problem solving on the Web. The efforts provide some hints and various methods to support personalized search, and can be considered as a step forward user centric knowledge retrieval on the Web. From the standpoint of the Active Media Technology (AMT) on the Wisdom Web, in this paper, the study on the characteristics of research interests is based on complex networks and human dynamics, which can be considered as an effort towards utilizing information physics to discover and explain the phenomena related to research interests of scientists. The application of research interests aims at providing scientific researchers best means and best ends in an active way for literature search on the Web. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

Challenge participants record provenance, run queries over it, and export/import provenance as OPM documents with other teams to verify interoperability.

In this paper, we present TripleCloud, a system that aims to lower the entry cost to exploring Web-scale RDF data sets. The system takes advantage of existing cloud based key-value stores (e.g. BigTable, HBase) to both enable scalability as well as hide the complexities of infrastructure deployment and maintenance. It layers over these key-value stores a robust query engine able to return approximate answers. We test the scalability of the approach scaling to over 3 billion triples for complex queries. In addition to an implementation over HBase, TripleCloud runs over the Google App Engine, allowing us to perform a cost evaluation of the approach. © 2011 IEEE.",

From the viewpoints of user interests retention and granular information processing, we examine various strategies for user-centric unification of search and reasoning. Inspired by the basic level for human problem-solving in cognitive science, we refine a query based on retained user interests. We bring the multi-level, multi-perspective strategies from human problem-solving to large-scale search and reasoning. The power/exponential law-based interests retention modeling, network statistics-based data selection, and ontology-supervised hierarchical reasoning are developed to implement these strategies. As an illustration, we investigate some case studies based on a large-scale scientific literature dataset, DBLP. The experimental results show that the proposed strategies are potentially effective. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",

  title     = "ABox Abduction in the Description Logic ALC",
  abstract  = "Due to the growing popularity of Description Logics-based knowledge representation systems, predominantly in the context of Semantic Web applications, there is a rising demand for tools offering non-standard reasoning services. One particularly interesting form of reasoning, both from the user as well as the ontology engineering perspective, is abduction. In this paper we introduce two novel reasoning calculi for solving ABox abduction problems in the Description Logic ALC, i.e. problems of finding minimal sets of ABox axioms, which when added to the knowledge base enforce entailment of a requested set of assertions. The algorithms are based on regular connection tableaux and resolution with set-of-support and are proven to be sound and complete. We elaborate on a number of technical issues involved and discuss some practical aspects of reasoning with the methods. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

  abstract  = "The realization of Semantic Web reasoning is central to substantiating the Semantic Web vision. However, current mainstream research on this topic faces serious challenges, which forces us to question established lines of research and to rethink the underlying approaches. We argue that reasoning for the Semantic Web should be understood as {"}shared inference,{"} which is not necessarily based on deductive methods. Model-theoretic semantics (and sound and complete reasoning based on it) functions as a gold standard, but applications dealing with large-scale and noisy data usually cannot afford the required runtimes. Approximate methods, including deductive ones, but also approaches based on entirely different methods like machine learning or nature-inspired computing need to be investigated, while quality assurance needs to be done in terms of precision and recall values (as in information retrieval) and not necessarily in terms of soundness and completeness of the underlying algorithms.",

  abstract  = "Reasoning is computationally expensive. This is especially true for reasoning on the Web, where data sets are very large and often described by complex terminologies. One way to reduce this complexity is through the use of approximate reasoning methods which trade one computational property (eg. quality of answers) for others, such as time and memory. Previous research into approximation on the Semantic Web has been rather ad-hoc, and we propose a framework for systematically studying such methods. We developed a workbench which allows the structured combination of different algorithms for approximation, reasoning and measuring in one single framework. As a case-study we investigate an incremental method for instance retrieval through ontology approximation, and we use our workbench to study the computational behaviour of several approximation strategies.",

  abstract  = "Modern medical vocabularies can contain up to hundreds of thousands of concepts. In any particular use-case only a small fraction of these will be needed. In this paper we first define two notions of a disease-centric subdomain of a large ontology. We then explore two methods for identifying disease-centric subdomains of such large medical vocabularies. The first method is based on lexically querying the ontology with an iteratively extended set of seed queries. The second method is based on manual mapping between concepts from a medical guideline document and ontology concepts. Both methods include concept-expansion over subsumption and equality relations. We use both methods to determine a breast-cancer-centric subdomain of the SNOMED CT ontology. Our experiments show that the two methods produce a considerable overlap, but they also yield a large degree of complementarity, with interesting differences between the sets of concepts that they return. Analysis of the results reveals strengths and weaknesses of the different methods.",

Additionally, the redundancy of these statements in multiple fora makes it difficult to determine attribution, quality and provenance. To tackle these challenges, the Concept Web Alliance has promoted the notion of nanopublications (core scientific statements with associated context). In this document, we present a model of nanopublications along with a Named Graph/RDF serialization of the model. Importantly, the serialization is defined completely using already existing community-developed technologies. Finally, we discuss the importance of aggregating nanopublications and the role that the Concept Wiki plays in facilitating it. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",

Meanwhile data streams have become more and more important as a basis for higher level decision processes that require complex reasoning over data streams and rich background knowledge. In previous work the foundation for complex reasoning over streams and background knowledge was laid by introducing technologies for wrapping and querying streams in the RDF data format and by supporting simple forms of reasoning in terms of incremental view maintenance. In this paper, we discuss how this existing technologies should be extended toward richer forms of reasoning using Sensor Networks as a motivating example.",

  abstract  = "Stream reasoning, an unexplored yet high impact research area, is a new multidisciplinary approach that can provide the abstractions, foundations, methods, and tools required to integrate data streams, the Semantic Web, and reasoning systems, thus providing a way to answer our initial questions and many others. Stream reasoning can benefit numerous areas, including traffic monitoring and traffic pattern detection that appear to provide a natural application area. Dealing with users' stream of experience, mobile applications must reason on what part of the streaming information is relevant and what its meaning is. Stream reasoning requires continuous processing, because queries are normally registered and remain continuously active while data streams into the stream-reasoning system. Streams can appear in multiple forms, ranging from relation data over binary messaging protocols, such as data streams originated by sensor networks, to text streams over Web protocols, such as blogs and microblogs.",

  abstract  = "Through technologies such as RSS (Really Simple Syndication), Web Services, and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), the Internet has facilitated the emergence of applications that are composed from a variety of services and data sources. Through tools such as Yahoo Pipes, these “mash-ups” can be composed in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components provided by multiple institutions (i.e., Google, Amazon, your neighbor). However, when using these applications, it is not apparent where data comes from or how it is processed. Thus, to inspire trust and confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to analyze their processes after the fact. These trailing analyses, in particular the determination of the provenance of a result (i.e., the process that led to it), are enabled by process documentation, which is documentation of an application's past process created by the components of that application at execution time. In this article, we define a generic conceptual data model that supports the autonomous creation of attributable, factual process documentation for dynamic multi-institutional applications. The data model is instantiated using two Internet formats, OWL and XML, and is evaluated with respect to questions about the provenance of results generated by a complex bioinformatics mash-up.",

  abstract  = "Expressing contractual agreements electronically potentially allows agents to automatically perform functions surrounding contract use: establish- ment, fulfilment, renegotiation etc. For such automation to be used for real busi- ness concerns, there needs to be a high level of trust in the agent-based system. While there has been much research on simulating trust between agents, there are areas where such trust is harder to establish. In particular, contract proposals may come from parties that an agent has had no prior interaction with and, in competitive business-to-business environments, little reputation information may be available. In human practice, trust in a proposed contract is determined in part from the content of the proposal itself, and the similarity of the content to that of prior contracts, executed to varying degrees of success. In this paper, we argue that such analysis is also appropriate in automated systems, and to provide it we need systems to record salient details of prior contract use and algorithms for as- sessing proposals on their content.We use provenance technology to provide the former and detail algorithms for measuring contract success and similarity for the latter, applying them to an aerospace case study.",

Methods: We propose to exploit and combine knowledge templates with medical background knowledge from existing thesauri in order to produce reusable building blocks used in guideline development. These tem- plates enable easier guideline formalization, by describing how chunks of medical knowledge can be combined into more complex ones and how they are linked to a textual representation. Results: By linking our ontology used in guideline formalization with existing thesauri, we can use compilations of thesauri knowledge as building blocks for modeling and maintaining the content of a medical guideline. Conclusions: Our paper investigates whether medical knowledge acquired from several medical thesauri can be molded on a guideline pattern, such that it supports building of executable models of guidelines. © 2009 Schattauer.",

Secondly, we show that it is possible to decom- pose these task-types into a small number of primitive (“atomic”) inference steps. We give semi-formal defini- tions for both the task-types and the primitive inference steps that we identify.

We present Marvin, a parallel and distributed platform for processing large amounts of RDF data, on a network of loosely coupled peers. We present our divide-conquer-swap strategy and show that this model converges towards completeness. Within this strategy, we address the problem of making distributed reasoning scalable and load-balanced. We present SpeedDate, a routing strategy that combines data clustering with random exchanges. The random exchanges ensure load balancing, while the data clustering attempts to maximise efficiency. SpeedDate is compared against random and deterministic (DHT-like) approaches, on performance and load-balancing. We simulate parameters such as system size, data distribution, churn rate, and network topology. The results indicate that SpeedDate is near-optimally balanced, performs in the same order of magnitude as a DHT-like approach, and has an average throughput per node that scales with sqrt(i) for i items in the system. We evaluate our overall Marvin system for performance, scalability, load balancing and efficiency. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We propose a heuristic-based analysis of a workflow that aims at evaluating its definition, considering different design aspects and characteristics that affect its repairability (called repairability factors), in order to determine if the workflow schema supports repairable executions of its activities through the application of repair actions. The analysis intents to identify and evaluate the impact of critical design flaws affecting the repairability of workflows. The results of this analysis are fed back to the workflow designer and used to improve the repairability of the workflow by making appropriate changes to its definition.",

For computers, learning from natural human instruction remains a challenge as it is plagued with incompleteness and ambiguity. Instructions sre often given out of order and are not always consistent. Moreover, humans assume that the learnerhas a wealth of knowledge and skills, which computersdo not always have. Our goal is to develop an electronic student that can be made increasingly capable through research to learn from human tutorial instruction. Initially, we will provide our student with human understandable instruction that is extended with many scaffolding statements that supplement the limited initialcapabilities of the student. Over time, improvements to the system are driven and quantified by the removal of scaffolding instructions that are not consideredto be natural for users to provide humans. This paper describes our initial design and implementationof this system, how it learns from scaffolded instruction in two different domains, and the initial relaxations of scaffolding that the system supports.",

  abstract  = "Objective: Medical critiquing systems compare clinical actions performed by a physician with a predefined set of actions. In order to provide useful feedback, an important task is to find differences between the actual actions and a set of 'ideal' actions as described by a clinical guideline. In case differences exist, the critiquing system provides insight into the extent to which they are compatible. Methods and material: We propose a computational method for such critiquing, where the ideal actions are given by a formal model of a clinical guideline, and where the actual actions are derived from real world patient data. We employ model checking to investigate whether a part of the actual treatment is consistent with the guideline. Results: We show how critiquing can be cast in terms of temporal logic, and what can be achieved by using model checking. Furthermore, a method is introduced for off-line computing relevant information which can be exploited during critiquing. The method has been applied to a clinical guideline of breast cancer in conjunction with breast cancer patient data. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  abstract = "Re-using and combining multiple ontologies on the Web is bound to lead to inconsistencies between the combined vocabularies. Even many of the ontologies that are in use today turn out to be inconsistent once some of their implicit knowledge is made explicit. However, robust and efficient methods to deal with inconsistencies are lacking from current Semantic Web reasoning systems, which are typically based on classical logic. In earlier papers, we have proposed the use of syntactic relevance functions as a method for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies. In this paper, we extend that work to the use of semantic distances. We show how Google distances can be used to develop semantic relevance functions to reason with inconsistent ontologies. In essence we are using the implicit knowledge hidden in theWeb for explicit reasoning purposes. We have implemented this approach as part of the PION reasoning system. We report on experiments with several realistic ontologies. The test results show that a mixed syntactic/semantic approach can significantly improve reasoning performance over the purely syntactic approach. Furthermore, our methods allow to trade-off computational cost for inferential completeness. Our experiment shows that we only have to give up a little quality to obtain a high performance gain.",

However, determining the destination peer in the first place is not always trivial. We propose a model in which peers advertise their expertise in the Peer-to-Peer network. The knowledge about the expertise of other peers forms a semantic topology. Based on the semantic similarity between the subject of a query and the expertise of other peers, a peer can select appropriate peers to forward queries to, instead of broadcasting the query or sending it to a random set of peers. To calculate our semantic similarity measure, we make the simplifying assumption that the peers share the same ontology. We evaluate the model in a bibliographic scenario, where peers share bibliographic descriptions of publications among each other. In simulation experiments complemented with a real-world field experiment, we show how expertise-based peer selection improves the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system with respect to precision, recall and the number of messages.",

In order to make the reasoning procedure between the fuzzy assertions efficiently, the notion of the fuzzy constraint is considered. A fuzzy constraint is an expression in which both syntax ingredient and semantics information are contained. By using the notion of the constraint, the reasoning procedure between the fuzzy assertions can be directly considered in the semantics environment, thus a fuzzy reasoning formal system which contains fuzzy constraint as its basic element is developed. As a main work of the paper, the relationship between the validity of the new assertion and the satisfiability of the fuzzy constraints is analyzed, and reasoning rules of the fuzzy reasoning formal system based on first order modal logic are given out. Further work could be done by considering the soundness and completeness of the formal system, and by building an efficient mechanism of reasoning procedure.

  abstract  = "Most current attempts to achieve reliable knowledge sharing on a large scale have relied on pre-engineering of content and supply services. This, like traditional knowledge engineering, does not by itself scale to large, open, peer to peer systems because the cost of being precise about the absolute semantics of services and their knowledge rises rapidly as more services participate. We describe how to break out of this deadlock by focusing on semantics related to interaction and using this to avoid dependency on a priori semantic agreement; instead making semantic commitments incrementally at run time. Our method is based on interaction models that are mobile in the sense that they may be transferred to other components, this being a mechanism for service composition and for coalition formation. By shifting the emphasis to interaction (the details of which may be hidden from users) we can obtain knowledge sharing of sufficient quality for sustainable communities of practice without the barrier of complex meta-data provision prior to community formation.",

It appears to be difficult, in practice, to standardise in this way because the way in which we represent knowledge is strongly influenced by the ways in which we expect to use it. We present a form of knowledge sharing that is based not on direct sharing of {"}true{"} statements about the world but, instead, is based on sharing descriptions of interactions. By making interaction specifications the currency of knowledge sharing we gain a context to interpreting knowledge that can be transmitted between peers, in a manner analogous to the use of electronic institutions in multi-agent systems. The narrower notion of semantic commitment we thus obtain requires peers only to commit to meanings of terms for the purposes and duration of the interactions in which they appear. This lightweight semantics allows networks of interaction to be formed between peers using comparatively simple means of tackling the perennial issues of query routing, service composition and ontology matching. A basic version of the system described in this paper has been built (via the OpenKnowledge project); all its components use established methods; many of these have been deployed in substantial applications; and we summarise a simple means of integration using the interaction specification language itself.",

Its safe semantics and automatic memory management make it a prime candidate for programming robust Web services. Although Prolog is commonly seen as a component in a Web application that is either embedded or communicates using a proprietary protocol, we propose an architecture where Prolog communicates to other components in a Web application using the standard HTTP protocol. By avoiding embedding in external Web servers, development and deployment become much easier. To support this architecture, in addition to the transfer protocol, we must also support parsing, representing and generating the key Web document types such as HTML, XML and RDF. This article motivates the design decisions in the libraries and extensions to Prolog for handling Web documents and protocols. The design has been guided by the requirement to handle large documents efficiently. The described libraries support a wide range of Web applications ranging from HTML and XML documents to Semantic Web RDF processing. The benefits of using Prolog for Web-related tasks are illustrated using three case studies. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",

Recently the idea attracted attention because of the growing number of available ontologies, which in turn opens up new opportunities, and reduces the problem of nding candi- date background knowledge. Particularly interesting is the approach of using multiple ontologies as background knowledge, which we explore in this paper. We report on an experimental study conducted using real-life ontologies published online. The rst contribution of this paper is an exploration about how the matching performance behaves when multiple background ontologies are used cumulatively. As a second contribution, we analyze the impact that dierent types of background ontologies have to the matching perfor- mance. With respect to the precision and recall, more background knowl- edge monotonically increases the recall, while the precision depends on the quality of the added background ontology, with high quality tending to increase, and the low quality tending to decrease the precision.",

While in software engineering modularization is mainly a vehicle for supporting distributed development and re-use, in knowledge representation, the main goal of modularization is efficiency of reasoning. In this paper, we concentrate on the benefits of modularization in the context of ontologies, explicit representations of the terminology used in a domain. We define a formal representation for modular ontologies based on the notion of Distributed Description Logics and introduce an architecture that supports local reasoning by compiling implied axioms. We further address the problem of guaranteeing the correctness and completeness of compiled knowledge in the presence of changes in different modules. We propose a heuristic for analyzing changes and their impact on compiled knowledge and guiding the process of updating compiled information that can often reduce the effort of maintaining a modular ontology by avoiding unnecessary re-compilation.",

  title     = "Extraction and use of linguistic patterns for modelling medical guidelines",
  abstract  = "Objective: The quality of knowledge updates in evidence-based medical guidelines can be improved and the effort spent for updating can be reduced if the knowledge underlying the guideline text is explicitly modelled using the so-called linguistic guideline patterns, mappings between a text fragment and a formal representation of its corresponding medical knowledge. Methods and material: Ontology-driven extraction of linguistic patterns is a method to automatically reconstruct the control knowledge captured in guidelines, which facilitates a more effective modelling and authoring of medical guidelines. We illustrate by examples the use of this method for generating and instantiating linguistic patterns in the text of a guideline for treatment of breast cancer, and evaluate the usefulness of these patterns in the modelling of this guideline. Results: We developed a methodology for extracting and using linguistic patterns in guideline formalization, to aid the human modellers in guideline formalization and reduce the human modelling effort. Using automatic transformation rules for simple linguistic patterns, a good recall (between 72% and 80%) is obtained in selecting the procedural knowledge relevant for the guideline model, even though the precision of the guideline model generated automatically covers only between 20% and 35% of the human-generated guideline model. These results indicate the suitability of our method as a pre-processing step in medical guideline formalization. Conclusions: Modelling and authoring of medical texts can benefit from our proposed method. As pre-requisites for generating automatically a skeleton of the guideline model from the procedural part of the guideline text, to aid the human modeller, the medical terminology used by the guideline must have a good overlap with existing medical thesauri and its procedural knowledge must obey linguistic regularities that can be mapped into the control constructs of the target guideline modelling language.",

We introduce such lower and upper approximations based on rough-set semantics, and show that reasoning in these languages can be reduced to standard DL satisfiability. This allows us to apply Rough Description Logics in a study of medical trials about sepsis patients, which is a typical application for precise modeling of vague knowledge. The study shows that Rough DL-based reasoning can be done in a realistic use case and that modeling vague knowledge helps to answer important questions in the design of clinical trials.",

The methods developed in this field utilize complex data models and background knowledge. This data is generally represented ad hoc, making it difficult to analyze, combine and share data sets. In this paper we present our work on formalizing this representation using RDF(S). We discuss the requirements for a good representation, highlighting a number of non-trivial modeling decisions. We conclude with a description of the resulting system and the benefits for a recent investigation of the 2006 Dutch parliamentary campaign. This case study shows concrete improvements for annotating, querying, and analyzing data, but also indicates a number of aspects that were more difficult to model in RDF(S), contributing to the discussion on modeling with and improving RDF(S) and associated tools.",

  abstract  = "Composition of simpler web services into custom applications is understood as promising technique for information requests in a heterogeneous and changing environment. This is also relevant for applications characterised as deductive web mining (DWM). We suggest to use problem-solving methods (PSMs) as templates for composed services, We developed a multi-dimensional, ontologybased framework, and a collection of PSMs, which enable to characterise DWM applications at an abstract level; we describe several existing applications in this framework. We show that the heterogeneity and unboundedness of the web demands for some modifications of the PSM paradigm used in the context of traditional artificial intelligence. Finally, as simple proof of concept, we simulate automated DWM service composition on a small collection of services, PSM-based templates, data objects and ontological knowledge, all implemented in Prolog.",

Composition guided simply by the specifications of programs' inputs and outputs is insufficient to obtain reliable aggregate performance - hence the recognised need for process models to specify the interactions required between programs. These interaction models, however, are traditionally viewed as a consequence of service composition rather than as the focal point for facilitating composition. We describe an operational system that uses models of interaction as the focus for knowledge exchange. Our implementation adopts a peer to peer architecture, thus making minimal assumptions about centralisation of knowledge sources, discovery and interaction control.",

In order to provide useful feedback, an important task is to find differences between the actual actions and a set of 'ideal' actions as described by a clinical guideline. In case differences exist, insight to which extent they are compatible is provided by the critiquing system. We propose a methodology for such critiquing, where the ideal actions are given by a formal model of a clinical guideline, and where the actual actions are derived from real world patient data. We employ model checking to investigate whether a part of the actual treatment is consistent with the guideline. Furthermore, it is shown how critiquing can be cast in terms of temporal logic, and what can be achieved by using model checking. The methodology has been applied to a clinical guideline of breast cancer in conjunction with breast cancer patient data.",

An increasing amount of ontologies are becoming available in recent years, and if the Semantic Web is to be taken seriously, the problem of ontology mapping must be solved. Numerous approaches are being proposed, a yearly competition is being organized, and a number of survey papers have appeared. Nevertheless, with only a few exceptions, two obvious intuitions on ontology mapping have been overlooked: if humans perform {"}ontology mapping{"} in their daily life (a task we all solve every day), they do not do this in a vacuum. Instead, they exploit a rich body of background knowledge already shared by both agents involved in the mapping process. Similarly, humans do not expect that their daily-life ontology mapping is perfect. We can very well cope with approximate translations between concepts used by different agents (in fact, we are so good at it that we barely notice that we do this). In this talk I will discuss recent work where we have quantitatively shown that indeed, ontology mapping can benefit from background knowledge, and that, somewhat surprisingly, more background knowledge leads to continuously improving results. We also discuss how the use of such background knowledge can be exploited to find approximate mappings when perfect mappings cannot be found.",

  title     = "Using Google distance to weight approximate ontology matches",
  abstract  = "Discovering mappings between concept hierarchies is widely regarded as one of the hardest and most urgent problems facing the Semantic Web. The problem is even harder in domains where concepts are inherently vague and ill-defined, and cannot be given a crisp definition. A notion of approximate concept mapping is required in such domains, but until now, no such notion is vailable. The first contribution of this paper is a definition for approximate mappings between concepts. Roughly, a mapping between two concepts is decomposed into a number of submappings, and a sloppiness value determines the fraction of these submappings that can be ignored when establishing the mapping. A potential problem of such a definition is that with an increasing sloppiness value, it will gradually allow mappings between any two arbitrary concepts. To improve on this trivial behaviour, we need to design a heuristic weighting which minimises the sloppiness required to conclude desirable matches, but at the same time maximises the sloppiness required to conclude undesirable matches. The second contribution of this paper is to show that a Google based similarity measure has exactly these desirable properties. We establish these results by experimental validation in the domain of musical genres. We show that this domain does suffer from ill-defined concepts. We take two real-life genre hierarchies from the Web, we compute approximate mappings between them at varying levels of sloppiness, and we validate our results against a handcrafted Gold Standard. Our method makes use of the huge amount of knowledge that is implicit in the current Web, and exploits this knowledge as a heuristic for establishing approximate mappings between ill-defined concepts.",

  title     = "Improving medical protocols by formal methods",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: During the last decade, evidence-based medicine has given rise to an increasing number of medical practice guidelines and protocols. However, the work done on developing and distributing protocols outweighs the efforts on guaranteeing their quality. Indeed, anomalies like ambiguity and incompleteness are frequent in medical protocols. Recent efforts have tried to address the problem of protocol improvement, but they are not sufficient since they rely on informal processes and notations. Our objective is to improve the quality of medical protocols.APPROACH: The solution we suggest to the problem of quality improvement of protocols consists in the utilisation of formal methods. It requires the definition of an adequate protocol representation language, the development of techniques for the formal analysis of protocols described in that language and, more importantly, the evaluation of the feasibility of the approach based on the formalisation and verification of real-life medical protocols. For the first two aspects we rely on earlier work from the fields of knowledge representation and formal methods. The third aspect, i.e. the evaluation of the use of formal methods in the quality improvement of protocols, constitutes our main objective. The steps with which we have carried out this evaluation are the following: (1) take two real-life reference protocols which cover a wide variety of protocol characteristics; (2) formalise these reference protocols; (3) check the formalisation for the verification of interesting protocol properties; and (4) determine how many errors can be uncovered in this way.RESULTS: Our main results are: a consolidated formal language to model medical practice protocols; two protocols, each both modelled and formalised; a list of properties that medical protocols should satisfy; verification proofs for these protocols and properties; and perspectives of the potentials of this approach. Our results have been evaluated by a panel of medical experts, who judged that the problems we detected in the protocols with the help of formal methods were serious and should be avoided.CONCLUSIONS: We have succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility of formal methods for improving medical protocols.",

  title     = "Meaning on the web: Evolution vs intelligent design?",
  abstract  = "It is a truism that as the Web grows in size and scope, it becomes harder to find what we want, to identify like-minded people and communities, to find the best ads to offer, and to have applications work together smoothly. Services don't interoperate; queries yield long lists of results, most of which seem to miss the point. If the Web were a person, we would expect richer and more successful interactions with it - interactions that were, quite literally, more meaningful. That's because in human discourse, it is shared meaning that gives us real communication. Yet with the current Web, meaning cannot be found.Much recent work has aspired to change this, both for human-machine interchange and machine-machine synchronization. Certainly the {"}semantic web{"} looks to add meaning to our current simplistic matching of mere strings of characters against mere {"}bags{"} of words. But can we legislate meaning from on high? Isn't meaning organic and determined by use, a moving and context-dependent target? But if meaning is an evolving organic soup, how are humans able to get anything done with one another? Don't we love to {"}define our terms{"}? But then again, is real definition even possible?These questions have daunted philosophers for years, and we probably won't solve them here. But we'll try to understand what's at the root of our own current religious debate: should meaning on the Web be evolutionary, driven organically through the bottom-up human assignment of tags? Or does it need to be carefully crafted and managed by a higher authority, using structured representations with defined semantics? Without picket signs or violence (we hope), our panelists will explore the two extreme ends of the spectrum - and several points in between.",

  abstract  = "This chapter has demonstrated an elegant way to visually represent ontological data. We have described how the Cluster Map visualization can use ontologies to create expressive information visualizations, with the attractive property that classes and objects that are semantically related are also spatially close in the visualization. Another key aspect of the visualization is that it focuses on visualizing instances rather than ontological models, thereby making it very useful for information retrieval purposes. A number of applications developed in the past few years have been described that prominently incorporate the Cluster Map visualization. Based on these descriptions, we could distinguish a number of generic information retrieval tasks that are well supported by the visualization. These applications prove the usability and usefulness of the Cluster Map in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, these applications show the applicability of the visualization in Semantic Web-based environments, where lightweight ontologies are playing a crucial role in organizing and accessing heterogeneous and decentralized information sources.",

  title     = "Ontology-Based Information Visualization: Toward Semantic Web Applications",
  abstract  = "The Semantic Web is an extension of the current World Wide Web, based on the idea of exchanging information with explicit, formal, and machine-accessible descriptions of meaning. Providing information with such semantics will enable the construction of applications that have an increased awareness of what is contained in the information they process and that can therefore operate more accurately. This has the potential of improving the way we deal with information in the broadest sense possible, for example, better search engines, mobile agents for various tasks, or even applications yet unheard of. Rather than being merely a vision, the Semantic Web has significant backing from various institutes such as DARPA, the European Union, and the W3C, all of which have performed a variety of Semantic Web activities. In order to be able to exchange the semantics of information, one first needs to agree on how to explicitly model it. Ontologies are a mechanism for representing such formal and shared domain descriptions. They can be used to annotate data with labels (metadata) indicating their meaning, thereby making their semantics explicit and machine-accessible. Many Semantic Web initiatives emphasize the capability of machines to exchange the meaning of information. Although their efforts will lead to an increased quality of the application's results, their user interfaces often take little or no advantage of the increased semantics. For example, an ontology-based search engine could use its ontology to enrich the presentation of the resulting list to the end user, for example, by replacing the endless list of hits with a navigation structure based on the semantics of the hits. Visualization is becoming increasingly important in Semantic Web tools. In par-ticular, visualization is used in tools that support the development of ontologies, such as ontology extraction tools (OntoLift, Text-to-Onto) or ontology editors (Protégé, OntoLift). The intended users of these tools are ontology engineers that need to gain an insight into the complexity of the ontology. Therefore, these tools employ schema visualization techniques that primarily focus on the structure of the ontology (i.e., its concepts and their relationships). We presented a detailed overview of these tools in Fluit et al. (2003). The Cluster Map visualization technique, developed by the Dutch software vendor Aduna (http://aduna.biz), bridges the gap between complex semantic structures and 45 46 Visualizing the Semantic Web their simple, intuitive user-oriented presentation. It presents semantic data to end users who want to leverage the benefits of Semantic Web technology without being burdened with the complexity of the underlying metadata. For end users, instance information is often more important than the structure of the ontology that is used to describe these instances. Accordingly, the Cluster Map technique focuses on visualizing instances and their classifications according to the concepts of the ontology. We have reported in previous work (Fluit et al., 2002; 2003) on case studies that exploit the expressive power of this technique. Since then, the growth of the Semantic Web has made it possible to take this technology a step further and integrate it in three different applications. Two of them are employed within Semantic Web research projects. The third is a commercial information retrieval application. These appli-cations exhibit the characteristics of a typical Semantic Web tool: they provide easy (visual) access to a set of heterogeneous, distributed data sources and rely on Semantic Web encoding languages and storage facilities for the manipulation of the visualized data. This chapter is centered on the description of these three applications. First, we will explain the contents of the Cluster Map visualization and the kind of ontologies it visualizes in Section 3.2. Section 3.3 presents the three real-life applications that incorporate the visualization. These two sections lead to a discussion in Section 3.4 on how the visualization can support several user tasks, such as analysis, search, and exploration. Some considerations for future work and a summary conclude this chapter. 3.2 Cluster Map Basics",

  abstract  = "Just as the industrial society of the last century depended on natural resources, today's society depends on information. A lack of resources in the industrial society hindered development just as a lack of information hinders development in the information society. Consequently, the exchange of information becomes essential for more and more areas of society: Companies announce their products in online marketplaces and exchange electronic orders with their suppliers; in the medical area patient information is exchanged between general practitioners, hospitals and health insurances; public administration receive tax information from employers and offer online services to their citizens. As a reply to this increasing importance of information exchange, new technologies supporting a fast and accurate information exchange are being developed. Prominent examples of such new technologies are so-called Semantic Web and Peer-to-Peer technologies. These technologies address different aspects of the inherit complexity of information exchange. Semantic Web Technologies address the problem of information complexity by providing advanced support for representing and processing information. Peer-to-Peer technologies, on the other hand, address system complexity by allowing flexible and decentralized information storage and processing.",

  abstract  = "Work on the Semantic Web is all too often phrased as a technological challenge: how to improve the precision of search engines, how to personalise web-sites, how to integrate weakly-structured data-sources, etc. This suggests that we will be able to realise the Semantic Web by merely applying (and at most refining) the results that are already available from many branches of Computer Science. I will argue in this talk that instead of (just) a technological challenge, the Semantic Web forces us to rethink the foundations of many subfields of Computer Science. This is certainly true for my own field (Knowledge Representation), where the challenge of the Semantic Web continues to break many often silently held and shared assumptions underlying decades of research. With some caution, I claim that this is also true for other fields, such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Databases, and others. For each of these fields, I will try to identify silently held assumptions which are no longer true on the Semantic Web, prompting a radical rethink of many past results from these fields.",

The so-called Semantic Web aims at providing more and semantically richer structures in terms of ontologies and meta-data. A problem that remains is the combined use of heterogeneous sources. In a dynamic environment, it is no longer realistic to assume that the involved data sources act as if they were a single (virtual) source, modelled as a global schema, as is done in classical data integration approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach where we replace the role of a single virtual data source schema with a peer-to-peer approach relying on limited shared (or: overlapping) vocabularies between peers. Since overlaps between vocabularies of peers will be limited and the dynamic nature of the system prohibits the design of accurate mappings, query processing will have to be approximate. We provide a formal model for such approximate query processing based on limited shared vocabularies between peers, and we show how the quality of the approximation can be adjusted in a gradual manner. The result is a flexible architecture for query-processing in heterogenous and dynamic environments, based on a formal foundation. We present the approach and discuss it on the basis of a case study.",

Even when the terminologies cover the same domain, this is often a non-trivial task. The task is even more complicated when the terminology docs not contain much structure. In this paper we describe the initial results of a procedure for mapping a terminology with little or no structure to a structure-rich terminology. This procedure uses the knowledge of the structure-rich terminology and a method for semantic explication of concept descriptions. The first results shows that, when compared to approaches based on syntactic analysis only, the recall can be greatly improved without sacrificing much of the precision.",

In this paper, we show how ontologies can be contextualized, thus acquiring certain useful properties that a pure shared approach cannot provide. We say that an ontology is contextualized or, also, that it is a contextual ontology, when its contents are kept local, and therefore not shared with other ontologies, and mapped with the contents of other ontologies via explicit (context) mappings. The result is Context OWL (C-OWL), a language whose syntax and semantics have been obtained by extending the OWL syntax and semantics to allow for the representation of contextual ontologies.",

Current approaches to Web service configuration are often based on pre/post-condition-style reasoning, resulting in a planning-style approach to service configuration, configuring a composite web service {"}from scratch{"} every time. In this paper, we propose instead a knowledge-intensive brokering approach to the creation of composite Web services. In our approach, we describe a complex Web service as a fixed template, which must be configured for each specific use. Web service configuration can then be regarded as parametric design, in which the parameters of the fixed template have to be instantiated with appropriate component services. During the configuration process, we exploit detailed knowledge about the template and the components, to obtain the required composite web service. We illustrate our proposal by applying it to a specific family of Web services, namely {"}heuristic classification services{"}. We have implemented a proto-type of our knowledge-intensive broker and describe its execution in a concrete scenario.",

A Semantic Web Primer provides a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development as well as such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios. This substantially revised and updated second edition reflects recent developments in the field, covering new application areas and tools. The new material includes a discussion of such topics as SPARQL as the RDF query language; OWL DLP and its interesting practical and theoretical properties; the SWRL language (in the chapter on rules); OWL-S (on which the discussion of Web services is now based). The new final chapter considers the state of the art of the field today, captures ongoing discussions, and outlines the most challenging issues facing the Semantic Web in the future.

It has been argued that current Peer-to-Peer systems suffer from the lack of semantics. The SWAP project (Semantic Web and Peer-to-Peer) aims at overcoming this problem by combining the Peer-to-Peer paradigm with Semantic Web technologies. In the course of our investigations it turned out that the nature of Peer-to-Peer systems requires some compromises with respect to the use of semantic knowledge models. In particular, the notion of ontology does not really apply as we often do not find a shared understanding of the domain. In this paper, we propose a data model for encoding semantic information that combines features of ontology (concept hierarchies, relational structures) with a flexible description and rating model that allows us to handle heterogeneous and even contradictory views on the domain of interest. We discuss the role of this model in the SWAP environment and describe the model as well as its creation and access.",

  title     = "A Protocol for Multi-Agent Diagnosis with Spatially Distributed Knowledge",
  abstract  = "In a large distributed system it is often infeasible or even impossible to perform diagnosis using a single model of the whole system. Instead, several spatially distributed local models of the system have to be used to detect possible faults. Traditional diagnostic tools, however, are not suitable to deal with such a set of spatially distributed local models. A Multi-Agent System of diagnostic agents, where each agent has a model of a subsystem, may be proposed as a solution for establishing global diagnoses of large distributed systems. Unfortunately, establishing a global minimal diagnosis is NP-Hard, even if every agent is able to determine local minimal diagnoses in polynomial time. Moreover, communication overhead in establishing a global diagnosis will be high: unless P = NP a super-polynomial number of messages between the agents will be required for establishing a global diagnosis. In this paper we present a protocol that overcomes this complexity issue by exchanging diagnostic precision for enables agents to determine local minimal diagnoses that are consistent with global diagnoses. Moreover, the protocol ensures that no agent acquires knowledge of global diagnoses. The protocol does not guarantee that a combination of the agents' local minimal diagnoses is also a global minimal diagnosis. However, for every global minimal diagnosis, there is a combination of local minimal diagnoses.",

  abstract  = "Ontologies are shared models of a domain that encode a view which is common to a set of different parties. Contexts are local models that encode a party's subjective view of a domain. In this paper we show how ontologies can be contextualized, thus acquiring certain useful properties that a pure shared approach cannot provide. We say that an ontology is contextualized or, also, that it is a contextual ontology, when its contents are kept local, and therefore not shared with other ontologies, and mapped with the contents of other ontologies via explicit (context) mappings. The result is Context OWL (C-OWL), a language whose syntax and semantics have been obtained by extending the OWL syntax and semantics to allow for the representation of contextual ontologies.",

In this paper we report on our experiences in the formalisation and verification of a real-world medical protocol. We have fully formalised a medical protocol in a two-stage formalisation process. Then, we have used a theorem prover to confirm whether the protocol formalisation complies with certain protocol properties. As a result, we have shown that formal verification can be used to analyse, and eventually improve, medical protocols.",

  abstract  = "The large-scale and almost ubiquitous availability of information has become as much of a curse as it is a blessing. The more information is available, the harder it is to locate any particular piece of it. And even when it has been successfully found, it is even harder still to usefully combine it with other information we may already possess. This problem occurs at many different levels, ranging from the overcrowded disks of our own PCs to the mass of unstructured information on the World Wide Web. It is commonly understood that this problem of information sharing can only be solved by giving computers better access to the semantics of the information. While it has been recognized that ontologies play a crucial role in solving the open problems, most approaches rely on the existence of well-established data structures. To overcome these shortcomings, Stuckenschmidt and van Harmelen describe ontology-based approaches for resolving semantic heterogeneity in weakly structured environments, in particular the World Wide Web. Addressing problems like missing conceptual models, unclear system boundaries, and heterogeneous representations, they design a framework for ontology-based information sharing in weakly structured environments like the Semantic Web. For researchers and students in areas related to the Semantic Web, the authors provide not only a comprehensive overview of the State of the art, but also present in detail recent research in areas like ontology design for information integration, metadata generation and management, and representation and management of distributed ontologies. For professionals in areas such as e-commerce (e.g., the exchange of product knowledge) and knowledge management (e.g., in large and distributed organizations), the book provides decision support on the use of novel technologies, information about potential problems, and guidelines for the successful application of existing technologies.",

Ontologies are formal theories supporting knowledge sharing and reuse. They can be used to explicitly represent semantics of semi-structured information. These enable sophisticated automatic support for acquiring, maintaining and accessing information. Methodology and tools are developed for intelligent access to large volumes of semi-structured and textual information sources in intra- and extra-, and internet-based environments to employ the full power of ontologies in supporting knowledge management from the information client perspective and the information provider. The aim of the book is to support efficient and effective knowledge management and focuses on weakly-structured online information sources. It is aimed primarily at researchers in the area of knowledge management and information retrieval and will also be a useful reference for students in computer science at the postgraduate level and for business managers who are aiming to increase the corporations information infrastructure. The Semantic Web is a very important initiative affecting the future of the WWW that is currently generating huge interest. The book covers several highly significant contributions to the semantic web research effort, including a new language for defining ontologies, several novel software tools and a coherent methodology for the application of the tools for business advantage. It also provides 3 case studies which give examples of the real benefits to be derived from the adoption of semantic-web based ontologies in {"}real world{"} situations. As such, the book is an excellent mixture of theory, tools and applications in an important area of WWW research. Provides guidelines for introducing knowledge management concepts and tools into enterprises, to help knowledge providers present their knowledge efficiently and effectively. Introduces an intelligent search tool that supports users in accessing information and a tool environment for maintenance, conversion and acquisition of information sources. Discusses three large case studies which will help to develop the technology according to the actual needs of large and or virtual organisations and will provide a testbed for evaluating tools and methods. The book is aimed at people with at least a good understanding of existing WWW technology and some level of technical understanding of the underpinning technologies (XML/RDF). It will be of interest to graduate students, academic and industrial researchers in the field, and the many industrial personnel who are tracking WWW technology developments in order to understand the business implications.

  abstract  = "Recently, a widespread interest has emerged in using ontologies on the Web. Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) is a basic tool that enables users to define vocabulary, structure and constraints for expressing meta data about Web resources. However, it includes no provisions for formal semantics, and its expressivity is not sufficient for full-fledged ontological modeling and reasoning. In this paper, we will show how RDFS can be extended to include a more expressive knowledge representation language. That, in turn, would enrich it with the required additional expressivity and the semantics of that language. We do this by describing the ontology language Ontology Inference Layer (OIL) as an extension of RDFS. An important advantage to our approach is that it ensures maximal sharing of meta data on the Web: even partial interpretation of an OIL ontology by less semantically aware processors will yield a correct partial interpretation of the meta data.",

In a large dynamical system, it is often infeasible or even impossible to maintain a model of the whole system. Instead, several incomplete models of the system have to be used to establish a diagnosis and to detect possible faults. These models may also be physically distributed. A Multi-Agent System of diagnostic agents may offer solutions for establishing a global diagnosis. If we use a separate agent for each incomplete model of the system, establishing a global diagnosis becomes a problem of cooperation and negotiation between the diagnostic agents. This raises the question whether 'a set of diagnostic agents, each having an incomplete model of the system, can (efficiently) determine the same global diagnosis as an ideal single diagnostic agent having the combined knowledge of these agents?'.",

We have taken a medical protocol in daily use by medical specialists, modelled this knowledge in a specific-purpose knowledge representation language, and finally formalised this knowledge representation in terms of temporal logic and parallel programs. The value of this formalisation process is that each successive formalisation step has contributed to improving the quality of the original medical protocol, and that the final formalisation allows us to provide machine-assisted proofs of properties that are satisfied by the original medical protocol (or, alternatively, precise arguments why the original protocol fails to satisfy certain desirable properties). We believe that this the first time that a significant body of medical knowledge (in our case: a protocol for the management of jaundice in newborns) has been formalised to the extent that it becomes amenable to automated theorem proving, and that this has actually lead to improvement of the original body of medical knowledge.",

The definition of DAML+OIL is now over a year old, and the language has been in fairly widespread use. In this paper, we review DAML+OIL's relation with its key ingredients (XML, RDF, OIL, DAML-ONT, Description Logics), we discuss the design decisions and trade-offs that were the basis for the language definition, and identify a number of implementation challenges posed by the current language. These issues are important for designers of other representation languages for the Semantic Web, be they competitors or successors of DAML+OIL, such as the language currently under definition by W3C.",

  title    = "OIL Ontology Infrastructure to Enable the Semantic Web",
  abstract = "Currently computers are changing from single isolated devices to entry points into a worldwide network of information exchange and business transactions. Therefore, support in the exchange of data, information, and knowledge is becoming the key issue in computer technology today. Ontologies provide a shared and common understanding of a domain that can be communicated between people and across application systems. Ontologies will play a major role in supporting information exchange processes in various areas. A prerequisite for such a role is the development of a joint standard for specifying and exchanging Ontologies well-integrated with existing web standards. This paper deals with precisely this necessity. We will present OIL which is a proposal for such a standard enabling the semantic web, i.e. information with machine processable semantics. It is based on existing proposals such as OKBC, XOL and RDFS, and enriches them with necessary features for expressing rich ontologies. The paper presents the motivation, underlying rationale, modeling primitives, syntax, semantics, tool environment, and applications of OIL",

  abstract  = "Content-related metadata plays an important role in intelligent information systems. Especially on the world-wide web meaningful metadata describing the contents of a web-site is the key to intelligent retrieval and access of information. Metadata description standards like RDF and RDF schema have been developed and work in progress addresses the use of ontologies to provide a logical foundation for metadata. However, the acquisition of appropriate metadata is still a problem. The main part of the paper is concerned with the specification of ontologies and metadata models. We describe the Spectacle approach, a knowledge-based approach for metadata validation and generation as well as tools related to the ontology language OIL. We conclude that the specification of ontologies and the generation of metadata models are processes that supplement each other and propose a method for semi-automatic generation of metadata models on the basis of ontologies.",

  abstract  = "Medical protocols are widely recognised to provide clinicians with high-quality and up-to-date recommendations. A critical condition for this is of course that the protocols themselves are of high quality. In this paper we investigate the use of critiquing for improving the quality of medical protocols. We constructed a detailed formal model of the jaundice protocol of the American Association of Pediatrics in the Asbru representation language. We recorded the actions performed by a pediatrician while solving a set of test cases. We then compared these expert actions with the steps recommended by the formalised protocol, and analysed the differences that we observed. Even our relatively small test set of 7 cases revealed many mismatches between the actions performed by the expert and the protocol recommendations, which suggest improvements of the protocol. A major problem in our case study was to establish a mapping between the actions performed by the expert and the steps suggested by the protocol. We discuss the reasons for this difficulty, and assess its consequences for the automation of the critiquing process.",

In this paper we report on our experience with trying to achieve this ideal in a practical setting, by building a maintenance tool for an existing KBS. After a brief survey of various approaches to this problem described in literature, we select a domain-and task-specific modelling approach as the most promising and appropriate. First, we construct a domain ontology and a task model for the KBS system to be maintained, as well as a task analysis of the maintenance tool itself. The maintenance tool is subsequently implemented using a two layer architecture which seperates domain and system concepts. Although no full-scale evaluation has been undertaken, we report on our initial experience with this approach and present our conclusions.",

None of these approaches sees constructing a problem solver as a configuration task that could be solved with an appropriate configuration method. We introduce a representation of the functionality of problem-solving methods that allows us to view the construction of problem solvers as a configuration problem, and specifically as a parametric design problem. From the available methods for parametric design, we use propose-critique-modify for the automated configuration of problem-solving methods.

Characteristic for knowledge-based systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Specification languages for knowledge-based systems have to cover both aspects: they have to provide means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide means to specify the dynamic reasoning behaviour of a knowledge-based system. This paper will focus on the second aspect, which is an issue considered to be unsolved. For this purpose, we have surveyed existing approaches in related areas of research. We have taken approaches for the specification of information systems (i.e., Language for Conceptual Modelling and Troll), approaches for the specification of database updates and the dynamics of logic programs (Transaction Logic and Dynamic Database Logic), and the approach of Abstract State Machines.",

Unfortunately, the traditional formulation of the anomalies in the literature is very specific to a rule-based knowledge representation, which greatly restricts their applicability. In this paper, we show how the traditional anomalies can be reinterpreted in terms of conceptual models (in particular KADS inference structures). For this purpose, we present a formalisation of KADS inference structures which enables us to apply the traditional rule-base anomalies to these inference structures. This greatly improves the usefulness of the anomalies, since they can now be applied to a much wider class of knowledge-based systems. Besides this reformulation and wider applicability of the traditional anomalies, further contributions of this paper are a novel formalisation of KADS inference structures and a number of improvements to the existing formalisation of the traditional anomalies.",

Recent papers have argued that it is advantageous to do validation and verification in terms of a more abstract and formal specification of the system. However, constructing such formal specifications is a difficult task. This paper proposes the use of formal specification languages for KBS-development that are closely based on the structure of informal knowledge-models. The use of such formal languages has as advantages that (i) we can give strong support for the construction of a formal specification, namely on the basis of the informal description of the system; and (ii) we can use the structural correspondence to verify that the formal specification does indeed capture the informally stated requirements.",

As in other areas of computer science (knowledge engineering, software engineering, ontology engineering, process mining and others), such design patterns help to systematize the literature, clarify which combinations of techniques serve which purposes, and encourage re-use of software components. We have validated our set of compositional design patterns against a large body of recent literature."

abstract = "In recent years, there has been a growing interest from the digital humanities in knowledge graphs as data modelling paradigm. Already, this has led to the creation of many such knowledge graphs, many of which are now available as part of the Linked Open Data cloud. This presents new opportunities for data mining. In this work, we develop, implement, and evaluate (both data-driven and user-driven) an end-to-end pipeline for user-centric pattern mining on knowledge graphs in the humanities. This pipeline combines constrained generalized association rule mining with natural language output and facet rule browsing to allow for transparency and interpretability?two key domain requirements. Experiments in the archaeological domain show that domain experts were positively surprised by the range of patterns that were discovered and were overall optimistic about the future potential of this approach."
